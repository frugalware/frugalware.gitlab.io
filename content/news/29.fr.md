We are pleased to announce the immediate availability of the x86\_64 port of Frugalware 0.3.  

 Frugalware 0.3-x86\_64 is now a full-featured port of Frugalware, with almost all of the packages that are available on i686.  

 What does not work currently?  

* OpenOffice.org
* Official flash plugin (from Macromedia)
* Dosemu

  

 If you can, please test it. If you find a bug, report to [us](http://bugs.frugalware.org). Please include as many details as possible in the bugreport! Thank you.  

**Important:** You will need an AMD64 CPU to use 0.3-x86\_64! (Intel processors with EM64T extensions might work as well, but those are untested.)
