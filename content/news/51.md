If you are using current and you have a GeForce 4 graphics card (this is a lot of laptops), please do not do a system upgrade until the nvidia-96xx package is available tomorrow. Once it is available, install it. The latest version of nvidia removes support for GeForce 4 cards.  

  

 As a side note, the Frugalware developer team would like to wish all our users a very Merry Christmas, and a Happy New Year!
