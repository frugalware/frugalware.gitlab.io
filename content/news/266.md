As of today the kernel in frugalware-current is version 4.11. As it stands now the nvidia module is - again - using some GPL only
 functions so its impossible to provide a compiled package is it would be illegal.
 Until nvidia provides a fixed package upstream nvidia package with the patch is marked as nobuild.
