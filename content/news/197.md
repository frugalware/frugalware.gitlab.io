The Frugalware homepage is now available in Spanish and can be found
 here: <http://frugalware.org/es>.
 One of Frugalware's founding principles was that it be accessible to
 people in their native language and this is one step forward along
 that path. Many thanks to all who were involved in providing
 translations and we hope this continues for many years to come.
