KDE 3.4.0 packages are ready!  

 You can read the announcement [here](http://kde.org/announcements/announce-3.4.php).  

 You can read about the new features [here](http://developer.kde.org/development-versions/kde-3.4-features.html).  

 Packaging changes since 3.3.2:  

* Changing groups: If you want to install only the core kde packages, use 'pacman -S kde-core', if you want additional packages (k3b, krusader, etc) use 'pacman -S kde'.
* kde-i18n packages are in the 'extra/locale' group.

  

 New packages:
> kde-i18n-br, kde-i18n-fy, kde-i18n-ga, kde-i18n-lt, kde-i18n-mk, kde-i18n-se

  

 Removed packages:
> kde-i18n-af, kde-i18n-el, kde-i18n-fa, kde-i18n-gl, kde-i18n-hr, kde-i18n-mn, kde-i18n-ms, kde-i18n-uz, kde-i18n-zh\_TW

  

 Known "bugs" / need to fix:  

* A bug was found in the groupware support of kontact/kmail, which was too late for the KDE 3.4 release. Get [kdepim-fix-imap-resource-type.diff](http://download.kde.org/stable/3.4/src/kdepim-fix-imap-resource-type.diff) applied to the sources before you're using the groupware wizard. For more information, see <http://kde.org/info/3.4.php>
* If you start the OpenOffice.org, and choose File -> Open, then the dialog appears shortly. After that the KDE Crashmanager come up with the following message:  

 The Program Openoffice (kdefilepicker) crash and send signal 11  

 It's fixed in the OOo2 KDE builds. (See <http://bugs.kde.org/show_bug.cgi?id=100849>.) As workaround on KDE side, add the following lines to your ~/.kde/share/config/kdeglobals:  

 [Development]  

 AutoCheckAccelerators=false
* Upgraders: after the usual 'pacman -Syu', use 'pacman -S kdelibs kdebase' again, otherwise you'll have problems with kde menus!
