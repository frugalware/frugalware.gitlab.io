 The Frugalware Developer Team is pleased to [announce](/news/163) the immediate availability of Frugalware 1.2, our twelfth stable release.  

 No new features have been added since 1.2rc2, but 62 changes have been made to fix minor bugs. If you didn't follow the changes during the pre/rc releases, here are the most important changes since 1.1 in no particular order:  

* Up to date packages: Linux kernel 2.6.32.8, GNU C library 2.11.1, Xorg 7.5, GNOME 2.28, KDE 4.3.5 to name a few major components.
* KMS (Kernel Mode-Setting) is now enabled by default for Intel and Radeon cards.
* PAM (Pluggable Authentication Modules) is now part of the base system.
* Introduced devtmpfs: you can now exclude /dev from backups, along with /proc and /sys.
* Removed several large games from the install images (CD/DVD) which means one less DVD or 4 less CDs.
* We finally upgraded our KDE (and related) packages to the 4.x branch. The work started back in April 2009 and now we thought it's a good move to merge that testing repository.
* This release comes with Xorg 7.5, see the [upstream list of new features](http://www.x.org/releases/X11R7.5/doc/RELNOTES.html#AEN26).
* We've updated our bluez userspace stack to the 4.x branch, which allowed us to improve both GNOME and KDE bluetooth support.
