As of kernel-2.6.22-6 in Frugalware-current, Intel users will have /dev/sd\* devices rather than /dev/hd\* ones. The reason is the following: It was not possible to boot the kernel on some machines without this change. See [this bugreport](http://bugs.frugalware.org/2243) for more details. So after upgrading using pacman -Syu, you need to:
 1. Check if you have an Intel IDE controller using sudo lspci |grep -i intel.\*ide. If you got no result then probably you're not affected.
2. Edit /etc/fstab: change all occurrences of /dev/hd to /dev/sd.
3. Edit /boot/grub/menu.lst: change all occurrences of /dev/hd to /dev/sd in the Frugalware entry.
4. Reboot.


 Thanks for your understanding!
