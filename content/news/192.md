 Merry Christmas to everyone in the Frugalware community. Even if you
 don't celebrate Christmas as a Christian festival, it's a good time
 to reflect on your achievements and plan for the year ahead. 2010 has
 been an interesting, exciting and productive year for Frugalware Linux.
 Events have included many new developers and contributors.
 Thankyou to everyone who has contributed to our success, including:
 developers, contributors, translators, artists, bloggers, those who
 reported bugs and everyone who participated in the mailing lists and
 forums. In a community like Frugalware's, *everyone's* contribution
 is vital to our success.
 Plans for 2011 are still in development, but you can be sure it will be
 even more busy and exciting than 2010. In the meantime, we wish you the
 very best of the season and look forward to "seeing" you again next
 year.
