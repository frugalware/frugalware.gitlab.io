The Frugalware Developer Team is pleased to [announce](/news/170) the immediate availability of Frugalware 1.3pre1, the first technical preview of the upcoming 1.3 stable release.
Here are some of the major improvements and changes since 1.2:  

* Improvements:
	+ For the first time in the history of Frugalware Linux, we're offering an official graphical netinstall image, search for the "-gui" suffix on the ftp mirrors.
	+ This time we've verified that no workaround is needed to install this release in VMware and because of this, the relevant note is removed from the documentation.
* Package updates:
	+ Linux kernel 2.6.33
	+ GNOME 2.30
	+ KDE 4.4.2
	+ Updated all the E17 packages (version 0.9.9.063)
	+ More than 1000 package updates
	+ Exactly 100 new packages
