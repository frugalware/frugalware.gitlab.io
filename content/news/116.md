The Frugalware Developer Team is pleased to [announce](/news/116) the immediate availability of Frugalware 1.0pre1, the first technical preview of the upcoming 1.0 stable release.  

 A short and incomplete list of changes since 0.9:  

* Improvements:
	+ The first **F**rugal**w**are **I**nstaller **F**ront-**E**nd landed in the package repository. Yes, a graphical one! This means currently you can use it to bootstrap a new Frugalware system from an existing one, but we promise we'll improve in this area. :-)
	+ Initial 'ppc' port. It has been actively tested on Apple boxes: iBook/Power Macintosh models, but IBM hardware is not yet supported (it may or may not work). We also paid special attention to make sure common non-x86 problems, such as playing [youtube](http://frugalware.org/~vmiklos/pics/shots/youtube-ppc.png) or [Java applets](http://frugalware.org/~vmiklos/pics/shots/javaplugin-ppc.png) work where possible.
	+ The support for having a 32-bit chroot on x86\_64 is now arrived. The key package is called emul32-tools. If you run this architecture, check out its [documentation](http://ftp.frugalware.org/pub/other/emul32-tools/emul32-tools/emul32-tools.html)!
	+ This release should install and run fine on multiple previously unsupported ASUS Eee PC models, due to the recent installer improvements and the new ath9k driver.
* Package updates:
	+ Linux 2.6.27 + security fixes
	+ GCC 4.3.2
	+ GNOME 2.24.1
	+ OpenOffice.org 3.0
	+ More than 800 other package updates
	+ More than 80 new packages
