The Frugalware Developer Team is pleased to [announce](/news/161) the immediate availability of Frugalware 1.2rc2, the second candidate of the upcoming 1.2 stable release.
Here are some of the major improvements and changes since 1.2rc1:  

* Improvements:
	+ This release comes with Xorg 7.5, see the [upstream list of new features](http://www.x.org/releases/X11R7.5/doc/RELNOTES.html#AEN26).
	+ We've updated our bluez userspace stack to the [4.x branch](http://wiki.bluez.org/wiki/Roadmap#BlueZ4.x), which allowed us to improve both GNOME and KDE bluetooth support.
* Package updates:
	+ Linux kernel 2.6.32.8 + fixes
	+ OpenOffice.org 3.2.0
	+ libopensync 0.3x (the old 0.2x branch did not support KDE4)
