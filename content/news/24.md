We are pleased to announce the immediate availability of the x86\_64 port of Frugalware 0.3pre1.  

 Frugalware 0.3pre1-x86\_64 is a native 64-bit system, which means we don't use multilib. (For example because of this, you have to use our gplflash package instead of the usual flashplugin.)  

 What works?  

* base system :-)
* the graphical system's core
* desktop environments: KDE, Xfce and GNOME

  

 What does not work currently?  

* OpenOffice.org (we are working on it and we have promising results)
* I18n: Firefox, Thunderbird, KOffice

  

 If you can, please test it. If you find a bug, report to [us](mailto:frugalware-users@frugalware.org). Please include as many details as possible in the bugreport! Thank you.  

**Important:** You will need an AMD64 CPU to use 0.3pre1-x86\_64! (Intel processors with EM64T extensions might work as well, but those are untested.)
