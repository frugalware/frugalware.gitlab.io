Two arcticles are published about Frugalware Linux. The first is an interview on [jox.hu](http://www.jox.hu), a hungarian IT page. The article is available from [here](http://www.jox.hu/cikk/?id=141&r=12) (only in Hungarian). The second is on [Distrowatch.com](http://distrowatch.com). The Distrowatch staff chose the Frugalware Linux to the "Featured distribution of the week". They spent some time to install and evaluate other, well-known Linux distributions and decided to give our distro that title. You can read this article [here](http://distrowatch.com/weekly.php?issue=20050509#fdow).
