The Frugalware Developer Team is pleased to [announce](/news/173) the immediate availability of Frugalware 1.3pre2, the second technical preview of the upcoming 1.3 stable release.
Here are some of the major improvements and changes since 1.3pre1:  

* Improvements:
	+ The monolithic configuration of XOrg is now split to the [xorg.conf.d directory](http://www.x.org/wiki/Server18Branch). You can still use the monolithic config, but the config files in the new directory have priority.
	+ Updated image libraries: [libjpeg 8](http://freshmeat.net/projects/libjpeg/releases/314766) and [libpng 1.4](http://freshmeat.net/projects/libpng/releases/312969). While adding support for these new libraries, we touched 1500+ packages, doing various minor fixes and improvements [here and there](http://git.frugalware.org/gitweb/gitweb.cgi?p=frugalware-current.git;a=commit;h=33a8f8c592de7fa5881d6cd3a2ecb04663420545).
* Package updates:
	+ Linux 2.6.34
	+ KDE SC 4.4.4
	+ Mozilla Firefox 3.6.4
	+ OpenOffice.org 3.2.1
	+ Updated libraries: jack, libpng, libjpeg.

**NOTE**: Click [here](/docs/install#_choosing_installation_flavor) to read more about what media you need for the installation. Please also note that we've found a major [issue](http://git.frugalware.org/gitweb/gitweb.cgi?p=setup.git;a=commitdiff;h=b9aa426) after uploading the installer images. In case you get "Cannot find new threads: generic error" when the installer starts up, the workaround is to press Alt-F2, ENTER, the type "setup" to start the installer.
