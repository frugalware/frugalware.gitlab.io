[Frugalware's planet](http://planet.frugalware.org) - the web
 site which aggregates content from blogs - has moved from planetplanet
 software to bilboplanet. There were some issues with planetplanet and,
 after discussion amongst the development team, the change was done by
 Frugalware developer Devil505.  
  

 The rules state that only posts which are likely to be of interest to
 Frugalware's users are to be included, so if you subscribe you can enjoy
 reading about the laughter and tears, hopes and fears, successes and
 failures which make the community so exciting. Of course if have a blog,
 please consider adding it to the planet. To do this, go to the planet's
 home page and complete the subscription form.
