The upgrade to GRUB2 has been merged into current recently. This upgrade will not automatically break your system,  

 because it must be done manually by the user. GRUB1 will no longer be supported from now on, so you should proceed  

 with the upgrade as instructed [here](/docs/upgrade.html#_grub2_upgrade).
