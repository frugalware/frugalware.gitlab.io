The Frugalware Developer Team is pleased to [announce](/news/160) the immediate availability of Frugalware 1.2rc1, the first candidate of the upcoming 1.2 stable release.  

 A short and incomplete list of changes since 1.2pre2:  

* Improvements:
	+ We finally upgraded our KDE (and related) packages to the 4.x branch. The work started back in April 2009 and now we thought it's a good move to merge that testing repository.
	+ Updated artwork.
* Package updates:
	+ KDE 4.3.5
	+ GNU C Library 2.11.1
	+ Mozilla Firefox 3.6
	+ Thunderbird 3.0.1
	+ More than 400 other package updates
	+ More than 100 new packages
