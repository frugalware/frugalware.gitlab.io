In the last weeks after the release of Frugalware 2.1 crazy went forward and bumped gcc to version 6.2.1. In a concentrated effort all developers
 worked in the gcc6 WIP repo and rebuild many packages with the new toolchain.
 Yesterday we merged that WIP into current.
 If you do your usual "pacman-g2 -Syu" you will be prompted to upgrade pacman-g2 first. Then you will get an error about llvm.
 So before doing the pacman-g2 upgrade you have to remove llvm and readd it after:
 1. pacman-g2 -Rd llvm
2. pacman-g2 -Su
3. pacman-g2 -S llvm
4. pacman-g2 -Su
