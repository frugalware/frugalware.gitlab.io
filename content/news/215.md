 The Frugalware Developer Team is pleased to [announce](/news/213) the immediate availability of Frugalware 1.5, our fifteenth stable release.  

 No new features have been added since 1.5rc2, but 86 changes have been made to fix minor bugs. If you didn't follow the changes during the pre/rc releases, here are the most important changes since 1.4 in no particular order:  

* Updated packages: Linux kernel 2.6.39.3, XOrg server 1.10.3, GNOME 3, KDE SC 4.6.5, XFCE 4.8, LibreOffice 3.4.2, Mozilla Firefox 5.0.1 to name a few major components.
* New version of Pacman-g2 bringing [some nice features](http://git.frugalware.org/gitweb/?p=pacman-g2.git;a=blob_plain;f=NEWS;hb=5a09808268317836e3ee1d8dbb0fb37ebca6f3e9).
* [systemd](http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/systemd) is now the default init system.
* [Initial](http://elentir.sleipnir.fr/?p=489&lang=en) ARM port.
* The boot splash is now provided by plymouth.
* i686 and x86\_64 kernels can now boot from EFI. (However, the bootloader is not yet installable from setup.)
* In addition to EFI support, GPT partition tables are now enabled. gptfdisk is the recommended partitioner for this.
* The setuptools Python package is now replaced by distribute.
