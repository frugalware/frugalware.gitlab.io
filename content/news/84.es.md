Dear Frugalware-current users out there,  

 You probably noticed that we did not update X.Org for a while. This happened as in our opinion the version we already have packaged was still more stable then any of the newer versions, so we sticked to X.Org 7.2 and decided to maintain it, instead of upgrading to a newer version for some time. Now it's time to upgrade!  

 Finally upstream released an updated X server which seem to be: 1) as stable as the good old one we currently have, 2) featuring no more blocker problems like the ones in X.Org 7.3 did. So in short: time for testing!  

 We prepared a separate testing repo for this purpose as this update currently features more than 350 little changes. If you want to help, please:  

 1) Add 
```
Include = /etc/pacman-g2/repos/xorg73
```
 to /etc/pacman-g2.conf, before the frugalware-current line.  

 2) Create a file named /etc/pacman-g2/repos/xorg73 with the following contents:
 
```
[xorg73]
Server = http://ftp.frugalware.org/pub/other/people/krix/xorg73/frugalware-i686
```

 3) Issue the usual 
```
# pacman-g2 -Syu
```
 to update your system.  

 4) You can restart X by rebooting, or running 
```
# init 3 && init 4
```

 If no major problem occurs, we plan to merge the xorg73 branch at the end of the weekend.  

 Thanks for your help!
