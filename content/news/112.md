With the release of Solaria, the support for Kalgan is discontinued. It is highly recommended to upgrade to our new stable release, as there will be no more security and bug fixes for Kalgan.  
  

 We have released FSA394 to FSA525 for Kalgan. That means 131 security problems were issued in half a year (we shipped 98 security fixes for Sayshell, the stable release before Kalgan).  

 If you update to Solaria, it will also fix the following vulnerabilities:  

* [#2210 - bitchx](http://bugs.frugalware.org/task/2210)
* [#3037 - gnumeric](http://bugs.frugalware.org/task/3037)
* [#3174 - vim](http://bugs.frugalware.org/task/3174)
