With the release of Sayshell, the support for Terminus is discontinued. It is highly recommended to upgrade to our new stable release, as there will be no more security and bug fixes for Terminus.  
  

 We have released FSA135 to FSA295 for Terminus. That means 161 security problems were issued in half a year.  

 If you update to Sayshell, it will also fix the following vulnerabilities:  

* [#2055 - MySQL](http://bugs.frugalware.org/task/2055)
* [#2291 - mldonkey](http://bugs.frugalware.org/task/2291)
* [#2409 - QGit](http://bugs.frugalware.org/task/2409)
* [#2424 - OpenOffice](http://bugs.frugalware.org/task/2424)
* [#2429 - VMware](http://bugs.frugalware.org/task/2429)
* [#2456 - ImageMagick](http://bugs.frugalware.org/task/2456)
