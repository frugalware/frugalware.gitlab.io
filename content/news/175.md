Voting is open on Devil505's [blog](http://frugalware.org/~devil505/blog) for the default
 Frugalware 1.3 (Haven) wallpaper. A total of 22 fantastic submissions

 favourite. The chosen wallpaper will not only be the default wallpaper
 but also used as the basis for other themes, including GDM/KDM/SLiM
 themes. Voting closes at midnight on 17 July 2010 (French local time), so
 please do vote because it's a great opportunity to influence the look and
 feel of Frugalware.
