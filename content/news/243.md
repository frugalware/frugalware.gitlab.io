Kernel 3.6.2, which is only in current, has an ext4 data corruption bug.  

 It was only recently discovered, and was not found by routine testing on  

 our end. Upstream is working on a resolution, which will be pushed out to  

 current as soon as they have an official fix that has made it into a new  

 patch level. The bug is rare, and is reported to manifest only during two  

 or more successive reboots in rapid succession. If the information is  

 accurate, you should be fine if you are try to avoid this. But backup  

 of important data is still the best option. For full information, please
