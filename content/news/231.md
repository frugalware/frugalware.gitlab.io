This architecture has been removed and will no longer be supported. We lost our buildserver for it and no longer  

 possess the means to support it, as no developers are left to care for it as well. So, powerpc is being powered down.  

 If you possess such hardware, we are sorry, but there is no other choice for us. x86/x86\_64 support will continue to be  

 supported indefinitely, as they are much easier to support. Please join us there if you can.
