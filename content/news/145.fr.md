 The Frugalware Developer Team is pleased to [announce](/news/145) the immediate availability of Frugalware 1.1, our eleventh stable release.  

 No new features have been added since 1.1rc2, but 177 changes have been made to fix minor bugs. If you didn't follow the changes during the pre/rc releases, here are the most important changes since 1.0 in no particular order:  

* Up to date packages: Linux kernel 2.6.30.5, GNU C library 2.10.1, Xorg 7.4 with xorg-server 1.6, GNOME 2.26.3, XFCE 4.6.1, GCC 4.4.0 to name a few major components.
* Major review in the documentation: numerous grammatical fixes and various extensions.
* An x86\_64 flash plugin is now part of the default installation.
* Etoile is now part of the repository, see [this post](http://article.gmane.org/gmane.linux.frugalware.devel/6239) for more details.
* Major update on the graphical installer (fwife), see the changelog [here](http://git.frugalware.org/gitweb/gitweb.cgi?p=fwife.git;a=commitdiff;h=0.4) and [there](http://git.frugalware.org/gitweb/gitweb.cgi?p=fwife.git;a=commitdiff;h=0.5).
* Packaged android-sdk, for those who want network access from Frugalware through their Android phones.
* Just a FYI in case you are using the ext3 filesystem, which is our current default: though we ship the latest stable kernel, we did not switch the default value of the 'data' option to 'writeback', the feature which still makes ext3 seem more robust than ext4 at the time of writing. See [here](http://lwn.net/Articles/328363/) for more information.
* New artwork includes a new wallpaper and a new Gnome theme.
