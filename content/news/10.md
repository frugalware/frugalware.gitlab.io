We are pleased to inform our Hungarian users that the HUP (Hungarian Unix Portal) made a complete forum for us, which is available [here](http://hup.hu/modules.php?name=Forums&file=viewforum&f=56).  

 In the near future two new things will be available in our webpage: the Wiki page and our Forum.  

 Besides these things, the Frugalware will widen with the slovak language. The Frugalware User Documentation is ready (can be read [here](http://ftp.frugalware.org/pub/frugalware/frugalware-current/docs/html/sk/)) in slovak language, the translation of the setup and the init system is going on now.
