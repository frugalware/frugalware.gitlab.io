The Frugalware Developer Team is pleased to [announce](/news/207) the immediate availability of Frugalware 1.5pre2, the second technical preview of the upcoming 1.5 stable release.
Here are some of the major improvements, fixes and updates since 1.5pre1:  

* Package updates:
	+ Linux kernel 2.6.39
	+ LibreOffice 3.4
	+ KDE 4.6.4
* New features:
	+ The boot splash is now provided by [plymouth](http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/Plymouth).
	+ i686 and x86\_64 kernels can now boot from EFI. (However, the bootloader is not yet
	 installable from setup.)
	+ In addition to EFI support, GPT partition tables are now enabled. gptfdisk is the
	 recommended partitioner for this.


 Please refer to the Frugalware [Testing ChangeLog](http://ftp.frugalware.org/pub/frugalware/frugalware-testing/ChangeLog.txt) for more information.
