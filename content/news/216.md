Dear users,  
  


 I'm sorry to report that one of the important servers of the
 Frugalware infrastructure was compromised on August 25. It took
 a while to find out the details of how that was possible,
 read [here](http://article.gmane.org/gmane.linux.frugalware.devel/9899)
 if you're interested.  
  


 In short: we found that the attacker installed a backdoor
 similar to the one installed on kernel.org recently. We have already
 reinstalled the operating system, plus taken steps to prevent
 a similar attack in the future.  
  


 On the bright side, we verified that none of the Frugalware
 Git repos nor binary packages were modified during the
 attack, so you don't have to fear that Pacman-G2 installed any
 problematic updates on your computer.  
  


 Thanks for your understanding.
