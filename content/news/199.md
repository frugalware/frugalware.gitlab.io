 The Frugalware Developer Team is pleased to [announce](/news/197) the immediate availability of Frugalware 1.4, our fourteenth stable release.  

 The only added feature since 1.4rc2 is LibreOffice (replaces OpenOffice.org), additionally 109 changes have been made to fix minor bugs. If you didn't follow the changes during the pre/rc releases, here are the most important changes since 1.3 in no particular order:  

* Updated packages: Linux kernel 2.6.37, Xorg server 1.9, GNOME 2.32, KDE SC 4.5, Drupal 7, Python 2.7 to name a few major components.
* Missing koffice localization packages are back (they were missing since the integration of KDE4).
* New LCD font rendering available in GNOME. If you use digital video output, this will improve font appearance.
* OSSv4 has been added. Feel free to try it out if you have issues with ALSA.
* systemd is now available as an alternative of sysvinit (see [its wiki page](http://wiki.frugalware.org/index.php/Systemd#Installation) for more info).
* netconfig now supports mobile 3g connections though wvdial
* Booting from virtio devices is now supported, as long as you use a separate /boot partition. (see [here](http://vmiklos.hu/blog/playing-with-libvirt) for details)
* The GUI installer is now part of the default net/cd/dvd installer images, you don't have to download a separate image to use it.
