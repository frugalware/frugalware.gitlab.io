Our live-cd will be back soon since Baste has taken over as maintainer of the project Fwlive. Some ISO images are available [here](http://ftp.frugalware.org/pub/other/people/baste/livecd/).
 We are looking for testers. These ISO images are still beta and only in English and French. Please report bugs, feedback and requests to Baste on #frugalware IRC channel or the [Bug Tracker System](http://bugs.frugalware.org).
