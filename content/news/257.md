This is the second release candidate for Frugalware 1.9.  

  

 This release fixes a number of minor issues with the installer.  

* A case where TAB would cycle through the wrong order with the widgets in the partition formatting window is now fixed.
* Installer no longer relies on HOSTNAME for determining if it is within the live environment.
* It is now possible to skip IPv6 configuration and adding a new user.
* A case where a crash happened when the swap filesystem mount path is empty is now fixed.
* A missing locale file is now symlinked on new grub installs. It was a harmless bug, but still needed fixing.
* Installer now automatically starts after booting and the other TTYs have login information if you need shell access.
