 The Frugalware Developer Team is pleased to [announce](/news/253) the immediate availability of Frugalware 1.9, our nineteenth stable release.  

 No new features have been added since 1.9rc2. If you didn't follow the changes during the pre/rc releases, here are the most important changes since 1.8 in no particular order:  

* Updated packages: Linux kernel 3.10.17, XOrg server 1.14.2, GNOME 3.8, KDE 4.11, LibreOffice 4.1.2.3, Mozilla Firefox 22.0 to name a few major components.
* netconfig has been replaced by NetworkManager
* frugalwareutils has been replaced by the new fvbeutils
* vi binary symlinks are now configurable, used to be hardcoded to their packages
* old display-manager-legacy.service has been dropped for the new systemd method of individual service files
* console keymaps and x11 keymaps are now managed by the systemd method


 Additionally, this marks the first stable release using the new installer that has been in development for a year already.
 It was redesigned from the bottom up to be more resistant to user errors and to be more stable. It should be stable enough
 by now for general use. However, at least one major feature of the old installer is absent from the new one. Network install
 images will not be generated for this release as this feature has not been reimplemented yet. At present, only 2 image types are
 available. Basic, which contains only packages from base group. Full, which contains all the packages from the main package groups
 only. From now on, images will not contain packages from any of the -extra package groups. They will only be available via
 download after the installation is complete. One final note about the x86\_64 images. They support experimental booting on EFI
 systems, but they have no support for installing EFI bootloaders. If you wish to install to EFI, you will have to skip GRUB2 installation
 and install your own EFI bootloader instead.
