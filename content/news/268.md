Today I have some sad news.
The Frugalware project will be discontinued at the end of the year 2025.
Everything will be archived, so if someone steps up and wants to continue where we left: feel free.
If you want to encourage some original developers, come to the #frugalware.dev Channel on Libera.Chat.

For some history of the project, see [vmiklos Blog Post](https://vmiklos.hu/blog/frugalware-history.html).

I personally want to thank everyone involved in this project, giving me the chance to learn a lot more about the Linux Ecosystem than being a pure user would ever allow.
Special thanks go to vmiklos, who was never mad at me when I broke things, and crazy who is one of the technical smartest people I know.
