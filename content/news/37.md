Welcome to the brand new Frugalware homepage! This is a complete rewrite of our homepage, featuring table-less design, XML for data storage, user-friendly URLs with mod\_rewrite and easy translations with Gettext. If you would like to help translate the page, please post to the frugalware-devel mailing list. If you find any bugs while using the page, please report them to the [Bug Tracker](http://bugs.frugalware.org) under the Homepage category, or visit our IRC channel and report them to AlexExtreme or IroNiQ. Also, feel free to give them your comments on the page too.
