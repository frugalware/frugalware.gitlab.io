Xorg upgrades have been merged to current. There is some manual intervention  

 required due to strict version depends. You will need to remove some packages  

 by force before you can complete your next system upgrade. This command should  

 assist you in this:

 pacman-g2 -Rd ffmpeg-compiletime ffmpeg-0.6 ffmpeg-0.6-compiletime
