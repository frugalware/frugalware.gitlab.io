We have a new [bug tracker system](http://bugs.frugalware.org). Flyspray is obsolete since a while and we have chosen [trac](http://trac.edgewall.org/). All reports have been imported. If you has an account with the previous bts, you must reset your password as indicated on the main page.  
  

 Special thanks from Frugalware developers to Xarkam for his work!
