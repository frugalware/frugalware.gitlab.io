title: Frugalware
---


Frugalware is a general purpose linux distribution, designed for intermediate users (who are not afraid of text mode).

We try to make Frugalware as simple as possible while not forgetting to keep it comfortable for the user. We try to ship fresh and stable software, as close to the original source as possible, because in our opinion most software is the best as is, and doesn't need patching.
