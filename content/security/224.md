Security issues have been reported in the Linux Kernel, which can be exploited by malicious, local users to cause a DoS (Denial of Service).
 1) The USBLCD driver does not limit the memory consumption during writes to the device. This can be exploited to cause an out-of-memory condition by writing a large amount of data to an affected device.
 Successful exploitation requires write access to a device using the driver.
 2) A vulnerability is caused due to an error within the "decode\_choice()" function in net/netfilter/bf\_conntrack\_h323\_asn1.c when handling choices that are still encoded in the fixed-size bitfield. This can be exploited to cause access to undefined types, resulting in a crash.
