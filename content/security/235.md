1) Michal Zalewski has discovered a vulnerability in Mozilla Firefox, which can be exploited by malicious people to disclose sensitive information and conduct spoofing attacks.
 The vulnerability is caused due to an error in the handling of the "wyciwyg://" URI handler. This can be exploited to access or spoof contents from a previously cached web site e.g. via HTTP 302 redirects when a user visits a malicious web page.
 2) The problem is that Firefox registers the "firefoxurl://" URI handler and allows invoking firefox with arbitrary command line arguments. Using e.g. the "-chrome" parameter it is possible to execute arbitrary Javascript in chrome context. This can be exploited to execute arbitrary commands e.g. when a user visits a malicious web site using other browsers.
 3) Various errors in the browser engine can be exploited to cause memory corruption and potentially to execute arbitrary code.
 4) Various errors in the Javascript engine can be exploited to cause memory corruption and potentially to execute arbitrary code.
 5) An error in the "addEventListener" and "setTimeout" methods can be exploited to inject script into another site's context, circumventing the browser's same-origin policy.
 6) An error in the cross-domain handling can be exploited to inject arbitrary HTML and script code in a sub-frame of another web site.
 7) An unspecified error in the handling of elements outside of documents allows an attacker to call an event handler and execute arbitrary code with chrome privileges.
 8) An unspecified error in the handling of "XPCNativeWrapper" can lead to execution of user-supplied code.
 9) The vulnerability is caused due to an error within the handling of "about:blank" pages loaded by chrome in an addon. This can be exploited to execute script code under chrome privileges by e.g. clicking on a link opened in an "about:blank" window created and populated in a certain ways by an addon.
 Successful exploitation requires that certain addons are installed.
