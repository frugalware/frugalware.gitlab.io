Tavis Ormandy has discovered a vulnerability in DenyHosts, which can be exploited by malicious people to cause a DoS (Denial of Service).
 The vulnerability is caused due to an error in the parsing of log files before adding an entry in /etc/hosts.deny. This can be exploited to add arbitrary IP addresses to /etc/hosts.deny resulting in a DoS for that IP.
