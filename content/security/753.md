Multiple vulnerabilities have been reported in Wireshark, which can be exploited by malicious people to cause a DoS (Denial of Service) and compromise a user's system.
 1) NULL pointer dereference errors when reading certain packet information can be exploited to cause a crash.
 2) An error within the RLC dissector can be exploited to cause a buffer overflow via a specially crafted RLC packet capture file.
 Successful exploitation of this vulnerability may allow execution of arbitrary code.
 3) An error within the "lanalyzer\_read()" function (wiretap/lanalyzer.c) when parsing LANalyzer files can be exploited to cause a heap-based buffer underflow.
 Successful exploitation of this vulnerability may allow execution of arbitrary code.
 NOTE: A weakness within the file parser, which can lead to a crash when handling capture files has also been reported.
