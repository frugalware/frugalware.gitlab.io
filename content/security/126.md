Two vulnerabilities have been reported in Network Security Services (NSS), which potentially can be exploited by malicious people to compromise a vulnerable system.
 1) An integer underflow error when processing SSLv2 server messages can be exploited to cause a heap-based buffer overflow via a certificate with a public key too small to encrypt the "Master Secret".
 2) An integer underflow error when processing SSLv2 client master keys can be exploited to cause a stack-based buffer overflow via specially crafted parameters during an SSLv2 handshake.
 Successful exploitation of the vulnerabilities may allow execution of arbitrary code.
