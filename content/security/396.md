Some vulnerabilities have been reported in Ruby on Rails, which can be exploited by malicious people to disclose sensitive information and conduct cross-site scripting attacks.
 1) Input passed to the "to\_json" function is not properly sanitised before being returned to the user. This can be exploited to execute arbitrary HTML and script code in a user's browser session in context of an affected site.
 2) An error in ActiveResource when processing responses using the "Hash.from\_xml" function can be exploited to determine the existence of files and to read the contents of arbitrary XML files.
 3) A security issue is caused due to lib/action\_controller/cgi\_process.rb removing the ":cookie\_only" attribute from "DEFAULT\_SESSION\_OPTIONS" and can be exploited to conduct session fixation attacks against applications using the affected component.
