Some vulnerabilities have been reported in Inkscape, which potentially can be exploited by malicious people to compromise a user's system.
 1) A format string error exists in certain dialogs. This can be exploited to execute arbitrary code by tricking the user into opening a specially crafted URI containing format string specifiers.
 2) A format string error exists in the Whiteboard Jabber client, which potentially can be exploited to execute arbitrary code. Successful exploitation requires that the user is logged in to a Jabber server.
