* Unaffected: 2.6.24-4kalgan3


A vulnerability has been reported in the Linux Kernel, which can be exploited by malicious people to cause a DoS (Denial of Service) and potentially compromise a vulnerable system.
 The vulnerability is caused due to an error within the ASN.1 BER decoder of the cifs and ip\_nat\_snmp\_basic modules when calculating the buffer size. This can be exploited to cause a crash or potentially execute arbitrary code by sending specially crafted BER encoded data to a vulnerable system.
