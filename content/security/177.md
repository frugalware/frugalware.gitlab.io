Marsu has discovered a vulnerability in Gimp, which can be exploited by malicious people to compromise a user's system.
 The vulnerability is caused due to an error within the "set\_color\_table()" function in plug-ins/common/sunras.c. This can be exploited to cause a stack-based buffer overflow by e.g. tricking a user into opening a specially crafted .RAS file.
 Successful exploitation may allow the execution of arbitrary code.
