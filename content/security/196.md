Paul Martin has reported a security issue in xfsdump, which can be exploited by malicious, local users to disclose potentially sensitive information or manipulate data. The security issue is caused due to xfs\_fsr creating a temporary directory with insecure permissions within the function "tmp\_init()" in fsr/xfs\_fsr.c. This can be exploited to read or overwrite files created in this directory or subdirectories, potentially allowing for the disclosure of sensitive information or data manipulation.
