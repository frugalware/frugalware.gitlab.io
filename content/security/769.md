CVE-2014-0978: It was discovered that user-supplied input used in the yyerror() function in lib/cgraph/scan.l is not bound-checked before beeing copied into an insufficiently sized memory buffer. A context-dependent attacker could supply a specially crafted input file containing a long line to cause a stack-based buffer overlow, resulting in a denial of service (application crash) or potentially allowing the execution of arbitrary code.
 CVE-2014-1236: Sebastian Krahmer reported an overflow condition in the chkNum() function in lib/cgraph/scan.l that is triggered as the used regular expression accepts an arbitrary long digit list. With a specially crafted input file, a context-dependent attacker can cause a stack-based buffer overflow, resulting in a denial of service (application crash) or potentially allowing the execution of arbitrary code.
