Some vulnerabilities have been reported in the cd-info and iso-info applications of libcdio, which potentially can be exploited by malicious people to compromise a user's system.
 The vulnerabilities are caused due to boundary errors within the function "print\_iso9660\_recurse()" in cd-info.c and iso-info.c. This be exploited to cause a buffer overflow by e.g. tricking a user into using the iso-info application on a specially crafted ISO image.
