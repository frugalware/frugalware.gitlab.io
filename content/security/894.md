Yarom and Falkner discovered that RSA secret keys in applications using the libgcrypt11 library, for example GnuPG 2.x, could be leaked via a side channel attack, where a malicious local user could obtain private key information from another user on the system.
 Daniel Genkin, Adi Shamir, and Eran Tromer discovered that Libgcrypt was susceptible to an adaptive chosen ciphertext attack via physical side channels.
