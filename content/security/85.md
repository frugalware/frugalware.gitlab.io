The code mentioned in DSA 1244-1 is also included in MPlayer. A potential buffer overflow was found in the code used to handle RealMedia RTSP streams. When checking for matching asm rules, the code stores the results in a fixed-size array, but no boundary checks are performed. This may lead to a buffer overflow if the user is tricked into connecting to a malicious server. Since the attacker can not write arbitrary data into the buffer, creating an exploit is very hard; but a DoS attack is easily made.
