* Vulnerable: 1.1.4-2
* Unaffected: 1.1.4-3terminus1


Some vulnerabilities have been reported in xine-lib, which can potentially be exploited by malicious people to compromise a vulnerable system.
 The vulnerabilities are caused due to boundary errors in the "DMO\_VideoDecoder\_Open()" function in src/libw32dll/dmo/DMO\_VideoDecoder.c and in the "DS\_VideoDecoder\_Open()" function in src/libw32dll/DirectShow/DS\_VideoDecoder.c. These can be exploited to cause heap based buffer overflows and may allow execution of arbitrary code via a specially crafted media file.
