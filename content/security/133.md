Gerardo Richarte from Core Security Technologies identified a problem when using GnuPG in streaming mode.
 The problem is actually a variant of a well known problem in the way signed material is presented in a MUA. It is possible to insert additional text before or after a signed (or signed and encrypted) OpenPGP message and make the user believe that this additional text is also covered by the signature.
