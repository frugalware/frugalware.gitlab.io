Andy Polyakov has reported a vulnerability in OpenSSL, which can be exploited by malicious people to cause a DoS (Denial of Service) and potentially compromise a vulnerable system.
 The vulnerability is caused due to an unspecified error within the DTLS implementation. Successful exploitation may allow the execution of arbitrary code.
 Note: Reportedly, this vulnerability affects only clients and servers explicitly using DTLS.
