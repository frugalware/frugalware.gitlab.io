Otto Moerbeck has reported the following potential
 out of bounds of the allocated stack access in
 the yacc binary:

 Fix an venerable bug: if we're reducing a rule that has an empty
 right hand side and the yacc stackpointer is pointing at the very
 end of the allocated stack, we end up accessing the stack out of
 bounds by the implicit $$ = $1 action. Detected by my new malloc.
