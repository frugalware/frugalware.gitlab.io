Charlie Miller has discovered two vulnerabilities in OpenOffice.org Impress, which can be exploited by malicious people to compromise a user's system.
 1) An integer truncation error when parsing certain content can be exploited to cause a heap-based buffer overflow via a specially crafted file.
 2) A short integer overflow error when parsing certain content can be exploited to cause a heap-based buffer overflow via a specially crafted file.
 Successful exploitation of the vulnerabilities may allow execution of arbitrary code.
