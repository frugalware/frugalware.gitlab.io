* Unaffected: 9.0.124.0-1kalgan1


Some vulnerabilities have been reported in Adobe Flash Player, which can be exploited by malicious people to bypass certain security restrictions, conduct cross-site scripting attacks, or to potentially compromise a user's system.
 1) A boundary error exists in the processing of "Declare Function (V7)" tags. This can be exploited to cause a heap-based buffer overflow via specially crafted flags.
 2) An integer overflow in the processing of multimedia files can be exploited to cause a buffer overflow.
 Successful exploitation of the vulnerabilities may allow execution of arbitrary code.
 3) Errors when pinning a hostname to an IP address can be exploited to conduct DNS rebinding attacks.
 4) An error when sending HTTP headers can be exploited to bypass cross-domain policy files.
 5) An error exists in the enforcing of cross-domain policy files. This can be exploited to bypass certain security restrictions on web servers hosting cross-domain policy files.
 6) Input passed to unspecified parameters when handling e.g. the "asfunction:" protocol is not properly sanitised before being returned to the user. This can be exploited to inject arbitrary HTML and script code in a user's browser session in context of an affected site.
