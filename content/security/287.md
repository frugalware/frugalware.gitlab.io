A vulnerability has been reported in inotify-tools, which can potentially be exploited by malicious users to compromise an application using the library.
 The vulnerability is caused due to a boundary error within the "inotifytools\_snprintf()" function in src/inotifytools.c. This can be exploited to cause a buffer overflow by e.g. creating a file with an overly long filename in a specific directory.
 Successful exploitation may allow the execution of arbitrary code with privileges of the application using the affected library.
