Some vulnerabilities have been reported in Opera, where one vulnerability has an unknown impact and others can be exploited by malicious people to conduct cross-site scripting attacks and to compromise a user's system.
 1) Opera may launch external email or newsgroup clients incorrectly. This can be exploited to execute arbitrary commands by e.g. visiting a malicious website. Successful exploitation requires that the user has configured an external email or newsgroup client.
 2) An error when processing frames from different websites can be exploited to bypass the same-origin policy. This allows to overwrite functions of those frames and to execute arbitrary HTML and script code in a user's browser session in context of other sites.
