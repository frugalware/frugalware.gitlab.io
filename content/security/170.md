* Vulnerable: 2.6.20-5terminus2
* Unaffected: 2.6.20-5terminus3


Two vulnerabilities and a security issue have been reported in the Linux Kernel, which can be exploited by malicious people to cause a DoS (Denial of Service).
 1) An error exists within the processing of packets with IPv6 type 0 route headers. This can be exploited to cause a DoS due to high network traffic by sending specially crafted IPv6 packets to vulnerable systems.
 2) A boundary error due to the use of RTA\_MAX instead of RTN\_MAX in dn\_fib\_props[] within dn\_fib.c and in fib\_props[] within fib\_semantics.c can potentially be exploited to cause a DoS.
 3) The vulnerability is caused due to an error within the handling of NETLINK\_FIB\_LOOKUP reply messages. This can be exploited to cause an infinite recursion, which could result in a stack overflow.
