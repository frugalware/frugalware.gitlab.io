A vulnerability has been reported in Drupal, which can be exploited by malicious users to conduct script insertion attacks.
 User provided input is not properly sanitised before being used. This can be exploited to insert arbitrary HTML and script code, which will be executed in a user's browser session in context of an affected site when the malicious data is viewed and interpreted as UTF-7.
 Successful exploitation requires valid user credentials and privileges to edit pages for HTML exports or "administer taxonomy" permissions.
