Some vulnerabilities have been reported in phpMyAdmin, which can be exploited by malicious people to conduct cross-site scripting attacks.
 Input passed via unspecified parameters to files in /libraries is not properly sanitised before being returned to the user. This can be exploited to execute arbitrary HTML and script code in a user's browser session in context of an affected site.
 Successful exploitation requires that "register\_globals" is enabled and support for ".htaccess" files is disabled.
