Some vulnerabilities have been reported in MPlayer, which potentially can be exploited by malicious people to compromise a user's system.
 The vulnerabilities are caused due to multiple boundary errors within the "demux\_real\_fill\_buffer()" function in libmpdemux/demux\_real.c. These can be exploited to cause heap-based buffer overflows via specially crafted Real Media files.
 Successful exploitation may allow execution of arbitrary code.
