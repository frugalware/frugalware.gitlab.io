Some vulnerabilities have been reported in PHP, where some have unknown impacts and others can be exploited by malicious users to bypass certain security restrictions.
 1) An error with unknown impact exists within the "money\_format()" function when processing "%i" and "%n" tokens.
 2) An unspecified error exists within the "zend\_alter\_ini\_entry()" function. This can be exploited to trigger a memory\_limit interruption.
 3) Two integer overflow errors exist within the "gdImageCreate()" and "gdImageCreateTrueColor()" functions in ext/gd/libgd/gd.c. These can be exploited to cause a heap-based buffer overflow via overly large integer values passed as parameters to e.g. the "imagecreatetruecolor()" PHP function.
 4) Two integer overflow errors exist within the "gdImageCopyResized()" function in ext/gd/libgd/gd.c. These can be exploited to cause a heap-based buffer overflow via overly large integer values passed as parameters to the "imagecopyresized()" or "imagecopyresampled()" PHP functions. Successful exploitation of vulnerabilities #3 and #4 may allow execution of arbitrary code, which may lead to security restrictions (e.g. the "disable\_functions" directive) being bypassed, but requires that PHP is configured to use gd.
 5) An error exists within the handling of SQL queries containing "LOCAL INFILE" inside the MySQL and MySQLi extensions. This can be exploited to bypass the "open\_basedir" and "safe\_mode" directives.
 6) An error exists when processing "session\_save\_path()" and "ini\_set()" functions called from a ".htaccess" file. This can be exploited to bypass the "open\_basedir" and "safe\_mode" directives.
 7) An unspecified error exists within the "glob()" function. This can be exploited to bypass the "open\_basedir" directive.
 8) An unspecified error exists within the session extension. This can potentially be exploited to bypass the "open\_basedir" directive when the session file is a symlink.
