Some vulnerabilities have been reported in OpenLDAP, which can be exploited by malicious users to cause a DoS (Denial of Service).
 1) A vulnerability is caused due to the "add\_filter\_attrs()" function in servers/slapd/overlay/pcache.c not correctly NULL terminating "new\_attrs", which can be exploited to crash slapd due to an out of bounds memory access. Successful exploitation may require that slapd runs as proxy-caching server.
 2) An error within the normalisation of "objectClasses" can be exploited to crash a vulnerable server by sending a malformed "objectClasses" attribute.
