Renaud Lifchitz has reported a vulnerability in GNU gv, which can be exploited by malicious people to compromise a user's system.
 The vulnerability is caused due to a boundary error within the "ps\_gettext()" function in ps.c. This can be exploited to cause a stack-based buffer overflow by e.g. tricking a user into opening a specially crafted PostScript file.
