Multiple vulnerabilities have been reported in Mozilla SeaMonkey, which can be exploited by malicious people to conduct cross-site scripting attacks and potentially compromise a user's system.
 1)Various errors in the layout engine and JavaScript engine can be exploited to cause memory corruption and some may potentially allow execution of arbitrary code.
 2) An error when reducing the CPU's floating point precision, which may happen on Windows when loading a plugin creating a Direct3D device, may cause the "js\_dtoa()" function to not exit and instead cause a memory corruption.
 3) A boundary error when setting the cursor to a Windows bitmap using the CSS cursor property can be exploited to cause a heap-based buffer overflow.
 4) An unspecified error in the "watch()" JavaScript function can be exploited to execute arbitrary code.
 5) An error in LiveConnect causes an already freed object to be used and may potentially allow execution of arbitrary code.
 6) An error in the handling of the "src" attribute of IMG elements loaded in a frame can be exploited to change the attribute to a "javascript:" URI. This allows execution of arbitrary HTML and script code in a user's browser session.
 7) An error within the handling of SVG comment objects can be exploited to cause a memory corruption and allows execution of arbitrary code by appending an SVG comment object from one document into another type of document (e.g. HTML).
 8) A boundary error within the processing of mail headers can be exploited to cause a heap-based buffer overflow via an overly long "Content-Type" header in an external message body.
 9) A boundary error within the processing of rfc2047-encoded headers can be exploited to cause a heap-based buffer overflow.
