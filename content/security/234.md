Some vulnerabilities have been reported in Gimp, which can be exploited by malicious people to compromise a user's system.
 1) An integer overflow exists within the function "seek\_to\_and\_unpack\_pixeldata()" in plug-ins/common/psd.c. This can be exploited to cause a heap-based buffer overflow by tricking a user into opening a specially crafted PSD file with large width or height values.
 2) Multiple integer overflows exist within the DICOM, PNM, PSD, PSP, Sun RAS, XBM, and XWD loader plugins. These can potentially be exploited to cause a heap-based buffer overflow by tricking a user into opening specially crafted image files.
 Successful exploitation may allow execution of arbitrary code.
