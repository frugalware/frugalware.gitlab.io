Tavis Ormandy has reported some vulnerabilities in QEMU, which can be exploited by malicious uses to bypass certain security restrictions or cause a DoS (Denial of Service).
 1) A boundary error exists within the "cirrus\_invalidate\_region()" function of the Cirrus video driver, which can be exploited to cause a heap-based buffer overflow.
 2) The size of ethernet frames is not correctly checked against the "MTU" before being copied into the registers of the NE2000 network driver. This can be exploited to cause a heap-based buffer overflow.
 3) An integer signedness error when processing data in the NE2000 device registers can be exploited to cause a heap-based buffer overflow.
 Successful exploitation of 1) through 3) may allow the execution of arbitrary code.
 4) Errors when handling the "icebp" instruction can be exploited to cause a DoS by terminating the emulation session.
 5) An error within the handling of the "aam" instruction can result in a division by zero, which can be exploited to cause a DoS.
