Some vulnerabilities have been reported in Wireshark, which can be exploited by malicious people to cause a DoS (Denial of Service).
 Errors exist within the DHCP/BOOTP dissector or when processing HTTP chunked responses, iSeries capture files, or DCP ETSI, SSL, or MMS packets. These can be exploited to cause a crash, excessive loops, or consume large amounts of memory when parsing a specially crafted packet that is either captured off the wire or loaded via a capture file.
