Some vulnerabilities have been reported in OpenSSL, which can be exploited by malicious people to bypass certain security restrictions or cause a DoS (Denial of Service).
1) An error exists in the "ASN1\_STRING\_print\_ex()" function when printing "BMPString" or "UniversalString" strings. This can be exploited to trigger an access to invalid memory and cause a crash via an illegal encoded string length when e.g. printing the contents of a certificate.
2) The "CMS\_verify()" function incorrectly handles an error condition when processing malformed signed attributes. This can be exploited to trick an application into considering a malformed set of signed attributes valid and skip further checks.
Successful exploitation requires access to a previously generated invalid signature.
3) An error when processing malformed ASN1 structures can be exploited to trigger an access to invalid memory and cause a crash via a specially crafted certificate.
