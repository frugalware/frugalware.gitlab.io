A security issue has been reported in KDE, which can be exploited by malicious, local users to gain escalated privileges.
 The security issue is caused due to a race condition within KDM when creating the control socket during a user login. This can be exploited to change the access permissions of arbitrary files to world-writable, which can be leveraged to e.g. execute arbitrary code with escalated privileges.
