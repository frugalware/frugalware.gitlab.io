Some vulnerabilities have been reported in the Linux Kernel, which can be exploited by malicious, local users to cause a DoS (Denial of Service).
 1) An error exists within the handling of locking semaphores in "mincore()". This can be exploited to cause a deadlock by using the function on unmapped pages.
 2) An error exists within the "zlib\_inflate()" function when processing certain data streams. This can be exploited to corrupt memory by e.g. mounting a specially crafted cramfs image and performing a read operation on the mounted file system.
 3) The Kernel fails to handle corrupted data structures in the Ext2 file system correctly. This can be exploited to crash the system by mounting and reading a specially crafted file system image.
