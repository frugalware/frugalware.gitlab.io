Secunia Research has discovered some vulnerabilities in MPlayer, which can be exploited by malicious people to compromise a user's system.
 1) A boundary error within the "cddb\_query\_parse()" function in stream/stream\_cddb.c when parsing album titles can be exploited to cause a stack-based buffer overflow by tricking a user into parsing malicious CDDB entries via overly long album titles. Successful exploitation allows execution of arbitrary code.
 2) Boundary errors within the "cddb\_parse\_matches\_list()" and "cddb\_read\_parse()" functions in stream/stream\_cddb.c when parsing album and category titles can be exploited to cause stack-based buffer overflows by tricking a user into parsing malicious CDDB entries with overly long album or category titles. Successful exploitation allows execution of arbitrary code, but may require that the user connects to a malicious server.
