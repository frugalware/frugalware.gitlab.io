A vulnerability has been reported in Kerberos, which can be exploited by malicious people to cause a DoS (Denial of Service).
 The vulnerability is caused due to an assertion error within the "spnego\_gss\_accept\_sec\_context()" function in src/lib/gssapi/spnego/spnego\_mech.c when receiving an invalid packet, which can be exploited to e.g. crash an application using the library by sending a specially crafted packet.
