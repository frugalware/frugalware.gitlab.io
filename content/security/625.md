This fixes a vulnerability, which potentially can be exploited by malicious people to cause a DoS (immediate OOPS and hang, complete loss of response, even of console).
 The vulnerability is caused due to an error within the "ip\_defrag()" function in net/ipv4/ip\_fragment.c, which may be exploited to cause a NULL pointer dereference by sending overly large packets to a vulnerable system.
