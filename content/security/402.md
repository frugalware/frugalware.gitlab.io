k`sOSe has discovered a vulnerability in MPlayer, which potentially can be exploited by malicious people to compromise a user's system.
 The vulnerability is caused due to an integer overflow error in the "sdpplin\_parse()" function in stream/realrtsp/sdpplin.c. This can be exploited to overwrite arbitrary memory regions via an overly large "StreamCount" SDP parameter.
 Successful exploitation may allow execution of arbitrary code.
