Secunia Research has discovered a vulnerability in Evolution, which potentially can be exploited by malicious people to compromise a vulnerable system.
 A format string error in the "write\_html()" function in calendar/gui/e-cal-component-memo-preview.c when displaying a memo's categories can potentially be exploited to execute arbitrary code via a specially crafted shared memo containing format specifiers.
 Successful exploitation requires that the user opens a shared memo in their mailbox, clicks on "Accept", and views the memo under the "Memo" tab.
