Some vulnerabilities have been reported in MadWifi, which can be exploited by malicious people to gain knowledge of potentially sensitive information or cause a DoS (Denial of Service).
 1) An error within the "ieee80211\_input()" function when handling AUTH frames from IBSS nodes can be exploited to cause a kernel crash by sending specially crafted AUTH frames. Successful exploitation may require that the "Ad-Hoc" mode is used.
 2) MadWifi does not correctly handle Channel Switch Announcements. This can be exploited to force a channel switch thus interrupting the communication by injecting a Channel Switch Announcement with "CS Count" set to 1 or less.
 3) An error within ieee80211\_output.c may cause unencrypted packets to be sent before the WPA authentication is completed. This can be exploited to gain knowledge of certain sensitive information, which may be leveraged for further attacks.
