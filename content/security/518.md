* Vulnerable: 2.5.2-2kalgan1
* Unaffected: 2.5.2-2kalgan2


Some vulnerabilities have been reported in Python, where some have unknown impact and others can potentially be exploited by malicious people to cause a DoS (Denial of Service) or to compromise a vulnerable system.
 1) Various integer overflow errors exist in core modules e.g. stringobject, unicodeobject, bufferobject, longobject, tupleobject, stropmodule, gcmodule, mmapmodule.
 2) An integer overflow in the hashlib module can lead to an unreliable cryptographic digest results.
 3) Integer overflow errors in the processing of unicode strings can be exploited to cause buffer overflows on 32-bit systems.
 4) An integer overflow exists in the PyOS\_vsnprintf() function on architectures that do not have a "vsnprintf()" function.
 5) An integer underflow error in the PyOS\_vsnprintf() function when passing zero-length strings can lead to memory corruption.
 Successful exploitation of some of these vulnerabilities may allow to crash an application or to execute arbitrary code, but depends on the implementation of an Python application.
