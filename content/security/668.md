* Vulnerable: 2.6.32-4locris1
* Unaffected: 2.6.32-4locris2


Three vulnerabilities have been reported in the Linux Kernel, which can be exploited by malicious, local users to cause a DoS (Denial of Service).
 1) A vulnerability is caused due to a NULL-pointer dereference error within the "cifs\_create()" function in fs/cifs/dir.c. This can be exploited to cause a crash when a file without an associated "nameidata" structure is created.
 2) There was a check for mandatory locking where the GFS/GFS2 locking code skipped the lock in case sgid bits are set for the file. This can be triggered to cause a crash on a system mounting a GFS/GFS2 filesystem.
 3) The vulnerability is caused due to a memory leak within the "release\_one\_tty()" function in drivers/char/tty\_io.c, which can be exploited to e.g. cause a DoS due to memory exhaustion.
