* Vulnerable: 3.0.28-1
* Unaffected: 3.0.30-1kalgan1


Secunia Research has discovered a vulnerability in Samba, which can be exploited by malicious people to compromise a vulnerable system.
 The vulnerability is caused due to a boundary error within the "receive\_smb\_raw()" function in lib/util\_sock.c when parsing SMB packets. This can be exploited to cause a heap-based buffer overflow via an overly large SMB packet received in a client context.
 Successful exploitation allows execution of arbitrary code by tricking a user into connecting to a malicious server (e.g. by clicking an "smb://" link) or by sending specially crafted packets to an "nmbd" server configured as a local or domain master browser.
