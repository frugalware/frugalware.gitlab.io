Some vulnerabilities have been reported in the Linux kernel, which potentially can be exploited by malicious people to compromise a vulnerable system.
 1) The error-reporting functionality in (1) fs/ext2/dir.c, (2) fs/ext3/dir.c, and possibly (3) fs/ext4/dir.c in the Linux kernel 2.6.26.5 does not limit the number of printk console messages that report directory corruption, which allows physically proximate attackers to cause a denial of service (temporary system hang) by mounting a filesystem that has corrupted dir->i\_size and dir->i\_blocks values and performing (a) read or (b) write operations. NOTE: there are limited scenarios in which this crosses privilege boundaries.
 2) The i915 driver in (1) drivers/char/drm/i915\_dma.c in the Linux kernel 2.6.24 on Debian GNU/Linux and (2) sys/dev/pci/drm/i915\_drv.c in OpenBSD does not restrict the DRM\_I915\_HWS\_ADDR ioctl to the Direct Rendering Manager (DRM) master, which allows local users to cause a denial of service (memory corruption) via a crafted ioctl call, related to absence of the DRM\_MASTER and DRM\_ROOT\_ONLY flags in the ioctl's configuration.
 3) Linux kernel 2.6.28 allows local users to cause a denial of service ("soft lockup" and process loss) via a large number of sendmsg function calls, which does not block during AF\_UNIX garbage collection and triggers an OOM condition, a different vulnerability than CVE-2008-5029.
 Successful exploitation of the vulnerabilities may allow execution of arbitrary code.
