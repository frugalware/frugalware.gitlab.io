Two vulnerabilities have been reported in PowerDNS Recursor, which can be exploited by malicious people to cause a DoS (Denial of Service) and potentially compromise a vulnerable system.
 1) An error in length calculation when handling TCP DNS queries can be exploited to cause an overly large copy via a specially crafted packet. Successful exploitation may allow execution of arbitrary code.
 2) An error in the handling CNAME records can be exploited to crash the service.
