* Vulnerable: 2.4.3-1kalgan1
* Unaffected: 2.4.3-1kalgan2


A security issue has been reported in Pidgin, which can be exploited by malicious people to conduct spoofing attacks.
 The problem is that the certificate presented by e.g. a Jabber server at the beginning of an SSL session is not verified. This can be exploited to spoof valid servers via a man-in-the-middle attack.
 Successful exploitation requires that Pidgin is configured to use the NSS plugin.
