Some vulnerabilities have been reported in libwpd, which can be exploited by malicious people to cause a DoS (Denial of Service) or to compromise an application using the library.
 1) An integer overflow within the "WP6GeneralTextPacket::\_readContents" function can be exploited to cause a heap-based buffer overflow by e.g. tricking a user into opening a specially crafted WordPerfect document in an application using the library.
 2) Boundary errors within the "WP3TablesGroup::\_readContents()" and "WP5DefinitionGroup\_DefineTablesSubGroup::WP5DefinitionGroup\_DefineTablesSubGroup()" functions can be exploited to cause heap-based buffer overflows by e.g. tricking a user into opening a specially crafted WordPerfect document in an application using the library.
 Successful exploitation may allow the execution of arbitrary code.
