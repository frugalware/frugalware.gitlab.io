Some vulnerabilities have been reported in the Linux Kernel, which can be exploited by malicious, local users and by malicious people to cause a DoS (Denial of Service).
 1) An error within the "wait\_task\_stopped()" function can be exploited to cause a DoS by manipulating the state of a child process while the parent is waiting for the state to change (e.g. the parent is inside "wait()" or "waitpid()").
 2) An NULL-pointer dereference error exists within the "tcp\_sacktag\_write\_queue()" function when processing ACK packets. This can be exploited to crash an affected system via specially crafted ACK packets.
