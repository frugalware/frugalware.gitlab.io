* Vulnerable: 1.5.0-2
* Unaffected: 1.6.0-1kalgan1


Some vulnerabilities have been reported in rdesktop, which can be exploited by malicious people to compromise a user's system.
 1) An integer underflow error in iso.c when processing RDP requests can be exploited to cause a heap-based buffer overflow.
 2) An input validation error in rdp.c when processing RDP redirect requests can be exploited to cause a BSS-based buffer overflow.
 3) A signedness error within "xrealloc()" in rdesktop.c can be exploited to cause a heap-based buffer overflow.
 Successful exploitation allows execution of arbitrary code but requires that a user is tricked into connecting to a malicious RDP server.
