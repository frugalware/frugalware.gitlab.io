Sebastian Krahmer has reported a vulnerability in rsync, which can potentially be exploited by malicious people to compromise a vulnerable system.
 The vulnerability is caused due to an off-by-one error within the "f\_name()" function in flist.c and can be exploited to cause a one-byte stack-based buffer overflow via an overly long directory name.
