1) A vulnerability has been reported in Kerberos, which can be exploited by malicious people to cause a DoS (Denial of Service).
 The vulnerability is caused due to an assertion error within the "spnego\_gss\_accept\_sec\_context()" function in src/lib/gssapi/spnego/spnego\_mech.c when receiving an invalid packet, which can be exploited to e.g. crash an application using the library by sending a specially crafted packet.
 2) Joel Johnson has reported a vulnerability in Kerberos, which can be exploited by malicious users to potentially compromise a vulnerable system.
 The vulnerability is caused due to an error in KDC within the "process\_tgs\_req()" function in kdc/do\_tgs\_req.c when validating or renewing tickets and can be exploited to trigger a double-free condition.
 Successful exploitation may allow execution of arbitrary code.
 3) A vulnerability has been reported in Kerberos, which can be exploited by malicious users to cause a DoS (Denial of Service).
