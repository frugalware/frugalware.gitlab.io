Dan Rosenberg reported two security issues in glibc:
 1) "ncpmount" and "mount.cifs" failed to properly sanitize provided mountpoint directory names (specifically, special characters such as newlines were not stripped). An attacker could create a directory with newline characters in its name and issue an ncpmount / mount.cifs command to mount to that directory, allowing them to corrupt /etc/mtab and potentially add unauthorized mounting options for other devices.
 2) A memory corruption vulnerability in ld.so: When processing maliciously crafted ELF binaries using ld.so, regardless of whether execution of those binaries is intended (for example, using the "--verify" flag, which should not lead to any code execution), arbitrary code execution can be achieved.
