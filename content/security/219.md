Emanuele Aina has reported a security issue in Avahi, which can be exploited by malicious, local users to cause a DoS (Denial of Service).
 The security issue is caused due to an "assert()" error when receiving empty TXT data over D-Bus for registration. This can be exploited to terminate the Avahi daemon by sending empty TXT data.
