* Unaffected: 0.9.8-19locris1


Multiple vulnerabilities have been reported in OpenSSL:
 1) A vulnerability is caused due to certain applications (e.g. Apache with the PHP module) calling OpenSSL's "CRYPTO\_free\_all\_ex\_data()" function prematurely. In certain cases, this can result in memory leaks, which can be exploited to e.g. cause a DoS due to memory exhaustion.
 2) A vulnerability is caused due to an error in the TLS protocol while handling session re-negotiations. This can be exploited to insert arbitrary plaintext before data sent by a legitimate client in an existing TLS session via Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attacks.
 Successful exploitation may allow e.g. sending an arbitrary HTTP request under an authenticated context if certificate-based authentication is used by the server.
 4) A vulnerability is caused due to the library not properly verifying the return value of the "bn\_wexpand()" function.
 1) The library does not limit the number of buffered DTLS records with a future epoch. This can be exploited to exhaust all available memory via specially crafted DTLS packets.
 5) An error when processing DTLS messages can be exploited to exhaust all available memory by sending a large number of out of sequence handshake messages.
 6) A use-after-free error in the "dtls1\_retrieve\_buffered\_fragment()" function can be exploited to cause a crash in a client context.
 7) An error in the "dtls1\_process\_out\_of\_seq\_message()" function can be exploited to crash a DTLS server via a specially crafted out of sequence DTLS packet.
 8) The "kssk\_keytab\_is\_available()" function in ssl/kssl.c does not check the return value of a call to the "krb5\_sname\_to\_principal()" function, which can be exploited to cause a NULL pointer dereference by e.g. sending certain cipher suites within the client hello.
 9) An error exists within the "ssl3\_get\_record()" function in openssl/ssl/s3\_pkt.c when processing certain records, which can be exploited to cause a crash by sending specially crafted records.
 10) A vulnerability is caused due to an error when handling CMS (Cryptographic Message Syntax) structures. This can be exploited to trigger a write to an invalid memory address or a double-free via a specially crafted CMS structure containing an "OriginatorInfo" element.
