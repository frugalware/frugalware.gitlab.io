Some vulnerabilities have been reported in Cacti, which can be exploited by malicious people to conduct HTTP response splitting, cross-site scripting, and SQL injection attacks.
 1) Input passed to unspecified parameters is not properly sanitised before being used in SQL queries. This can be exploited to manipulate SQL queries by injecting arbitrary SQL code.
 2) Input passed to unspecified parameters is not properly sanitised before being returned to the user. This can be exploited to execute arbitrary HTML and script code in a user's browser session in context of an affected site.
 3) Input passed to unspecified parameters is not properly sanitised before being returned to the user. This can be exploited to insert arbitrary HTTP headers, which will be included in a response sent to the user, allowing for execution of arbitrary HTML and script code in a user's browser session in context of an affected site.
