* Vulnerable: 1.2.6-1
* Unaffected: 1.2.6-2kalgan1


Two vulnerabilities have been reported in SDL\_image, which can be exploited by malicious people to cause a DoS (Denial of Service) or potentially compromise an application using the library.
 1) A boundary error within the "LWZReadByte()" function in IMG\_gif.c can be exploited to trigger the overflow of a static buffer via a specially crafted GIF file.
 2) A boundary error within the "IMG\_LoadLBM\_RW()" function in IMG\_lbm.c can be exploited to cause a heap-based buffer overflow via a specially crafted IFF ILBM file.
