Two vulnerabilities have been reported in WordPress, which can be exploited by malicious people to conduct cross-site scripting attacks and cause a DoS (Denial of Service).
1) Certain unspecified input is not properly sanitised before being returned to the user. This can be exploited to execute arbitrary HTML and script code in a user's browser session in context of an affected site.
2) The "make\_clickable()" function in wp-includes/formatting.php does not properly check the URL length in comments before passing it to the PCRE library, which can be exploited to cause a crash.
