Some vulnerabilities have been reported in VLC Media Player, which can be exploited by malicious people to compromise a user's system.
 The vulnerabilities are caused due to format string errors in the Ogg/Vorbis, Ogg/Theora, CDDA (CD Digital Audio), and SAP (Service Announce Protocol) plugins. These can be exploited to execute arbitrary code via a specially crafted .ogg or .ogm file (Vorbis/Theora), CDDB entry, or SAP/SDP message.
