A vulnerability has been reported in the Linux Kernel, which can be exploited by malicious, local users to cause a DoS (Denial of Service).
 The vulnerability is caused due to the "svc\_listen()" function in net/atm/svc.c allowing users to create unassigned PVC/SVC entries by calling the function multiple times on a socket. This can be exploited to trigger an infinite loop within the "\_\_vcc\_walk()" function in net/atm/proc.c by creating unassigned entries and then e.g. reading from /proc/net/atm/vc.
