A vulnerability has been reported in VLC Media Player, which can potentially be exploited by malicious people to compromise a user's system.
 The vulnerability is caused due to a boundary error within the MP4 demuxer (modules/demux/mp4/mp4.c). This can be exploited to overwrite an almost arbitrary memory address via a specially crafted MPEG-4 file.
 Successful exploitation may allow execution of arbitrary code.
