Some vulnerabilities have been reported in OpenOffice.org, which potentially can be exploited by malicious people to compromise a user's system.
 1) Several vulnerabilities within the libwpd library used by OpenOffice.org can be exploited to cause heap-based buffer overflows and may allow the execution of arbitrary code by e.g. tricking a user into opening a specially crafted WordPerfect document.
 2) A boundary error within the StarCalc parser can be exploited to cause a stack-based buffer overflow and may allow execution of arbitrary code by e.g. tricking a user into opening a specially crafted document.
 3) Shell meta characters are not correctly escaped, which can be exploited to inject and execute arbitrary shell commands by e.g. tricking a user into opening a specially crafted document and clicking a malicious link.
