Benjamin Flesch has discovered a vulnerability in WordPress, which can be exploited by malicious people to conduct cross-site scripting attacks.
 Input passed to the "style" parameter in wp-admin/upload.php (when "post\_id" is set to a negative integer value) is not properly sanitised before being returned to the user. This can be exploited to execute arbitrary HTML and script code in a user's browser session in context of an affected site.
 Successful exploitation requires that the target user has valid author or higher credentials.
