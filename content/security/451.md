* Vulnerable: 1.3.3-2
* Unaffected: 1.3.5-1kalgan1


Viktor Griph has reported a security issue in Audacity, which can be exploited by malicious, local users to cause a DoS (Denial of Service) or to delete arbitrary files and directories.
 The security issue is caused due to the "AudacityApp::OnInit()" method in src/AudacityApp.cpp handling temporary files in an insecure manner. This can be exploited to delete arbitrary files and directories via symlink attacks, or to cause a deadlock.
