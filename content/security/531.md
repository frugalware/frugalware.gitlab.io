Two vulnerabilities have been reported in Drupal, which can be exploited by malicious people and users to bypass certain security restrictions.
 1) A vulnerability is caused due to improper access restriction in the core upload module. This can be exploited to retrieve files attached to content, without valid credentials for accessing the content itself.
 Successful exploitation of this vulnerability requires valid user credentials and that the core upload module is enabled.
 2) A vulnerability is caused due to improper access restriction in the node module API. This can be exploited to bypass node validation under some unspecified circumstances. No further information is currently available.
