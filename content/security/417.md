Luigi Auriemma has reported some vulnerabilities in xine-lib, which potentially can be exploited by malicious people to compromise a user's system.
 The vulnerabilities are caused due to integer overflow errors when allocating memory in src/demuxers/demux\_flv.c, src/demuxers/demux\_qt.c, src/demuxers/demux\_real.c, src/demuxers/demux\_wc3movie.c, src/demuxers/ebml.c, and src/demuxers/demux\_film.c. These can be exploited to cause heap-based buffer overflows via overly large fields included in e.g. FLV, MOV, RM, MVE, MKV, and CAK files.
