* Vulnerable: 2.45-1
* Unaffected: 2.45-2kalgan1


Secunia Research has discovered a vulnerability in Blender, which can be exploited by malicious people to compromise a vulnerable system.
 The vulnerability is caused due to a boundary error within the "imb\_loadhdr()" function in source/blender/imbuf/intern/radiance\_hdr.c, which can be exploited to cause a stack-based buffer overflow by e.g. tricking a user into opening a specially crafted Blender (\*.blend) file containing a malicious Radiance RGBE image.
 Successful exploitation allows execution of arbitrary code.
