Some vulnerabilities have been acknowledged in Apache, which can be exploited by malicious, local users to cause a DoS (Denial of Service) and by malicious people to conduct cross-site scripting attacks.
 1) An error in the mod\_status module can be exploited by malicious people to conduct cross-site scripting attacks.
 2) An error in the Multi-Processing Module (MPM) can be exploited by malicious, local users to cause a DoS.
 3) An error in the mod\_cache module in the handling of Cache-Control headers can be exploited to crash the child process via specially crafted requests. This could lead to a DoS if using a threaded Multi-Processing Module.
