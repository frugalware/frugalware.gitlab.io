Some vulnerabilities have been reported in CUPS, which potentially can be exploited by malicious people to compromise a vulnerable system.
 1) Two boundary errors exist in the implementation of the HP-GL/2 filter. These can be exploited to cause buffer overflows via HP-GL/2 files containing overly large pen numbers.
 2) A boundary error exists within the "read\_rle16()" function when processing SGI (Silicon Graphics Image) files. This can be exploited to cause a heap-based buffer overflow via a specially crafted SGI file.
 3) An integer overflow error exists within the "WriteProlog()" function included in the "texttops" utility. This can be exploited to cause a heap-based buffer overflow via a specially crafted file.
 Successful exploitation of the vulnerabilities may allow execution of arbitrary code.
