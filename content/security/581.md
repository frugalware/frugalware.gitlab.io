Four vulnerabilities have been reported in VLC Media Player, which potentially can be exploited by malicious people to compromise a user's system.
 1) A boundary error in the processing of TY files can be exploited to cause a stack-based buffer overflow.
 2) An integer overflow error in the processing of TY files can be exploited to cause a heap-based buffer overflow.
 3) An error in the CUE demuxer can be exploited to cause a stack-based buffer overflow via a specially crafted CUE image file.
 4) An error in the RealText demuxer can be exploited to cause a stack-based buffer overflow via a specially crafted RealText subtitle file.
 Successful exploitation of the vulnerabilities may allow execution of arbitrary code.
