* Vulnerable: 22.1-3kalgan1
* Unaffected: 22.1-3kalgan2


Morten Welinder has reported a vulnerability in GNU Emacs, which can be exploited by malicious people to compromise a user's system.
 The vulnerability is caused due to an error in the processing of fast-lock files (.flc) for corresponding source files. This can be exploited to execute arbitrary Emacs Lisp code when e.g. a source file is opened and a specially crafted fast-lock file exists in the same directory.
 Successful exploitation requires that "font-lock-support-mode" is set to "fast-lock-mode".
