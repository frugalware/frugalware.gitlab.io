Jeremias Reith has reported a vulnerability in WordPress, which can be exploited by malicious people to conduct script insertion attacks.
 Input passed via the HTTP "Host" header is not properly sanitised before being used. This can be exploited to execute arbitrary HTML and script code in a user's browser session in context of an affected site if malicious data is viewed.
 Note: Reportedly, this only affects IP-based virtual servers running on Apache 2.x.
