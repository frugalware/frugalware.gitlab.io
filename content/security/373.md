Some vulnerabilities and weaknesses have been reported Mozilla Firefox, which can be exploited by malicious people to disclose sensitive information, bypass certain security restrictions, conduct spoofing attacks, or to compromise a user's system.
 1) Various errors in the browser engine can be exploited to cause a memory corruption.
 2) Various errors in the Javascript engine can be exploited to cause a memory corruption.
 Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities may allow execution of arbitrary code.
 3) A security issue is caused due to a design error within the focus handling and can potentially be exploited to trick a user into uploading arbitrary files.
 4) An error in the Javascript engine can be exploited to run Javascript code with "chrome" privileges.
 5) An error in the Javascript engine can be exploited to bypass the same-origin policy via the "XMLDocument.load()" function.
 6) An error exists in the handling of images when a user leaves a page, which uses "designMode" frames. This can be exploited to disclose the user's navigation history, forward navigation information, and to cause a memory corruption.
 Successful exploitation of this vulnerability may allow execution of arbitrary code.
 7) A design error related to timer-enabled dialogs can be exploited to trick a user into unintentionally confirming a security dialog.
 8) The problem is that Firefox follows "302" redirects for stylesheets and allows reading the target URL via "element.sheet.href". This can potentially be exploited to disclose sensitive URL parameters.
 9) An error within the processing of color palettes within bitmaps can be exploited to disclose the contents of memory areas.
