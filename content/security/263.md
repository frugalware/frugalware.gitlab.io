Nikolaus Schulz has reported a security issue in id3lib, which can be exploited by malicious, local users to gain escalated privileges.
 The security issue is caused due to the "RenderV2ToFile()" function in src/tag\_file.cpp handling temporary files in an insecure manner. This can be exploited to execute arbitrary commands with escalated privileges (usually root user).
