Two vulnerabilities have been reported in Wireshark, which can be exploited by malicious people to cause a DoS (Denial of Service).
 1) An error in the Lucent/Ascend file parser can be exploited to cause an infinite loop via specially crafted packets.
 2) An infinite recursion error in the "elem\_cell\_id\_list()" function in epan/dissectors/packet-ansi\_a.c can be exploited to cause a stack overflow e.g. via a specially crafted MAP packet.
