Some vulnerabilities have been reported in Opera, which potentially can be exploited by malicious people to compromise a user's system.
 1) An error when prompting the user to add a newsfeed can be exploited to cause an invalid memory access via a specially crafted newsfeed source.
 2) An error exists in the processing of HTML CANVAS elements. This can be exploited to cause a memory corruption via specially crafted scaled pattern images.
 Successful exploitation of the vulnerabilities may allow execution of arbitrary code.
