Two vulnerabilities have been reported in ClamAV, which can be exploited by malicious people to cause a DoS (Denial of Service).
 1) Input passed via the "id" parameter when parsing MIME headers is not properly sanitised before being used to create local files. This can be exploited to e.g. overwrite the anti-virus signature file via directory traversal attacks, preventing malware from being detected.
 2) An file descriptor leak error in the processing of CAB files can be exploited to e.g. prevent legitimate users from sending out valid archives via a specially crafted CAB file with a cabinet header containing a record length of zero.
