Some weaknesses have been reported in mutt, which potentially can be exploited by malicious, local users to perform certain actions with escalated privileges.
 1) The "safe\_open()" function insecurely creates temporary files on NFS directories, because the O\_EXEC flag is not always correctly honored. This may be exploited to overwrite arbitrary files.
 2) A race condition exists within the "mutt\_adv\_mktemp()" function between calling "mktemp()" and "safe\_fopen()". This may be exploited to create files with weak permissions.
