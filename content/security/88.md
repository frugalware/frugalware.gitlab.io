Kevin Finisterre and LMH have reported a vulnerability in VLC media player, which can be exploited by malicious people to compromise a user's system.
 The vulnerability is caused due to a format string error when handling "udp://" URIs and can be exploited via a specially crafted web site or an M3U file with a specially crafted udp:// URI containing format string specifiers as the file name.
 Successful exploitation allows execution of arbitrary code.
