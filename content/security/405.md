A vulnerability has been discovered in OpenSSH, which can be exploited by malicious, local users to disclose sensitive information.
 The vulnerability is caused due to sshd improperly binding TCP ports on the local IPV6 interface if required ports on the IPV4 interface are in use. This can be exploited by a malicious, local user to intercept an X11 forwarding session by listening to a port used by sshd to forward the local X11 display (e.g. port 6010/TCP).
