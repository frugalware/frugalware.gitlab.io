A vulnerability has been reported in the Linux Kernel, which can be exploited by malicious people to cause a DoS (Denial of Service).
 The vulnerability is caused due to an off-by-two error within the function "ieee80211\_rx()" in net/ieee80211/ieee80211\_rx.c. This can be exploited to cause a kernel panic by sending a specially crafted ieee80211 frame with the IEEE80211\_STYPE\_QOS\_DATA flag set to an affected system.
