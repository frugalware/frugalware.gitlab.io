A vulnerability has been reported in Tor, which can be exploited by malicious people to bypass certain security restrictions.
 The vulnerability is caused due to the ControlPort (localhost:9051) handling commands without authentication when the first command was not a successful "authenticate" command. This can be exploited to e.g. modify the "torrc" file, when a user views a malicious web page containing a specially crafted POST request or via a malicious tor exit node.
 Successful exploitation may compromise a user's anonymity, but requires that the ControlPort is enabled.
