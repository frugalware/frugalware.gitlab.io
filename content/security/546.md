A vulnerability has been reported by VLC Media Player, which potentially can be exploited by malicious people to compromise a user's system.
 The vulnerability is caused due to a signedness error within the "parse\_track\_node()" function in modules/demux/playlist/xspf.c. This can be exploited to corrupt memory via a specially crafted XSPF file containing a negative "identifier" attribute.
 Successful exploitation may allow execution of arbitrary code.
