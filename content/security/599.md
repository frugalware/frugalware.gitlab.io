Some vulnerabilities have been reported in Sun Java, which can be exploited by malicious people to bypass certain security restrictions, cause a DoS (Denial of Service), or potentially compromise a user's system.
 1) An error while initialising LDAP connections can be exploited to render the LDAP service unresponsive.
 2) An error in the JRE LDAP client implementation can be exploited to load and execute arbitrary code via specially crafted data received from a malicious LDAP server.
 3) An integer overflow error in JRE when unpacking applets and in Java Web Start applications using the "unpack200" JAR unpacking utility can be exploited to potentially execute arbitrary code.
 4) An error in JRE when unpacking applets and in Java Web Start applications using the "unpack200" JAR unpacking utility can be exploited to cause a buffer overflow and potentially execute arbitrary code.
 5) Two errors when storing and processing temporary font files can be exploited by an untrusted applet or a Java Web Start application to consume an overly large amount of disk space.
 6) An error in the Java Plug-in when deserializing applets can be exploited to e.g. read, write, or execute local files.
 7) The Java Plug-in allows JavaScript code loaded from the local system to connect to arbitrary local ports. This can be exploited in combination with cross-site scripting attacks to access normally restricted local ports.
 8) The Java Plug-in allows applets to run in earlier versions of JRE if approved by the user. This can be exploited to trick a user into loading a malicious applet into an old and potentially vulnerable JRE version.
 9) An error in the Java Plug-in when processing crossdomain.xml files can be exploited by an untrusted applet to connect to arbitrary domains providing a crossdomain.xml file.
 10) An error in the Java Plug-in can be exploited by a signed applet to alter the contents of the security dialog and trick a user into trusting the applet.
 11) An error in the JRE virtual machine when generating code can be exploited to e.g. read, write, or execute local files.
 12) An integer overflow error in JRE when processing PNG splash screen images can be exploited by an untrusted Java Web Start application to cause a buffer overflow and potentially execute arbitrary code.
 13) An error in JRE when processing GIF splash screen images can be exploited by an untrusted Java Web Start application to cause a buffer overflow and potentially execute arbitrary code.
 14) An error in JRE when processing GIF images can be exploited by an untrusted applet or an untrusted Java Web Start application to cause a buffer overflow and potentially execute arbitrary code.
 15) A signedness error in JRE when processing Type1 fonts can be exploited to cause corrupt heap memory and potentially execute arbitrary code.
 16) An unspecified error in the JRE HTTP server implementation can be exploited to render a JAX-WS service endpoint unresponsive.
