Jonathan So has reported a vulnerability in Aircrack-ng, which can be exploited by malicious people to compromise a user's system. The vulnerability is caused due to a boundary error within the airodump-ng module when processing 802.11 authentication packets. This can be exploited to cause a stack-based buffer overflow via a specially crafted 802.11 packet. Successful exploitation allows execution of arbitrary code and requires that the application is logging packets with the -w or --write option.
