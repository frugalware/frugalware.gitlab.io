1) A grave bug was discovered that could cause a corrupted /etc/sudoers file if debug or error output was received via stderr while reading the file for subsequent processing.
 2) Kees Cook conducted a security audit of Smb4K 0.7.5. He found several security weaknesses in the utility programs (stack overflows / the use of strcpy instead of strncpy / a design error in smb4k\_kill) and in the Smb4KFileIO class (use of mktemp instead of mkstemp for creation of the temporary files which could lead to both a race and an information leak / a race in the code that handles the lock file).
