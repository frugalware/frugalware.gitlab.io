On 64-bit platforms, file descriptor passing could be abused by local users to cause heap corruption in dbus-daemon, leading to a crash, or potentially to arbitrary code execution.
 A denial-of-service vulnerability in dbus-daemon allowed local attackers to prevent new connections to dbus-daemon, or disconnect existing clients, by exhausting descriptor limits.
 Malicious local users could create D-Bus connections to dbus-daemon which could not be terminated by killing the participating processes, resulting in a denial-of-service vulnerability.
 dbus-daemon suffered from a denial-of-service vulnerability in the code which tracks which messages expect a reply, allowing local attackers to reduce the performance of dbus-daemon.
 dbus-daemon did not properly reject malicious connections from local users, resulting in a denial-of-service vulnerability.
