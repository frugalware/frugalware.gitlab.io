Some vulnerabilities have been reported in OpenOffice, which potentially can be exploited by malicious people to compromise a user's system.
 1) An error in the processing of WMF files can be exploited to cause a heap-based buffer overflow via a specially crafted StarOffice/StarSuite document.
 2) Multiple integer overflows when parsing certain EMR records of EMF files can be exploited to cause heap-based buffer overflows via a specially crafted StarOffice/StarSuite document.
 Successful exploitation of the vulnerabilities may allow execution of arbitrary code.
