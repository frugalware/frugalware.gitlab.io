 Sumit Siddharth has discovered two vulnerabilities in WordPress, which can be exploited by malicious users to conduct SQL injection attacks or to bypass certain security restrictions.
 1) Input passed to the "mt.setPostCategories" method in xmlrpc.php is not properly sanitised before being used in SQL queries. This can be exploited to manipulate SQL queries by injecting arbitrary SQL code. Successful exploitation allows e.g. retrieving usernames and password hashes, but requires valid user credentials.
 2) A vulnerability is caused due to improper authentication verification in xmlrpc.php. A user with contributor permissions can exploit this issue to publish posts. Successful exploitation requires valid user credentials.
