A vulnerability has been reported in libgsf, which potentially can be exploited by malicious people to compromise an application using the library.
 The vulnerability is caused due to a boundary error within the "ole\_info\_read\_metabat()" function in gsf/gsf-infile-msole.c. This can be exploited to cause a heap-based buffer overflow by e.g. tricking a user into opening a specially crafted file in an application using the library.
