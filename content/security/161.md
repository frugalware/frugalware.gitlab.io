Some vulnerabilities have been reported in ImageMagick, which can be exploited by malicious people to compromise a vulnerable system.
 1) A integer overflow error within the "ReadDCMImage()" function can be exploited to cause a heap-based buffer overflow when processing specially crafted DCM images.
 2) Two integer overflows within the "ReadXWDImage()" function when calculating the amount of memory to be allocated for the 'colors' or 'comment' fields can be exploited to cause heap-based buffer overflows when processing specially crafted XWD images.
