Some vulnerabilities have been reported in OpenOffice, which can potentially be exploited by malicious people to compromise a user's system.
 1) An error exists when parsing the "prdata" tag in RTF files where the first token is smaller that the second one. This can be exploited to cause a heap-based buffer overflow by e.g. tricking a user into opening a specially crafted RTF files.
 2) A vulnerability is caused due to the use of a vulnerable copy of the FreeType library, which can be exploited to cause a heap based buffer overflow by e.g. tricking a user into opening a specially crafted document.
