A flaw was found in the way guest provided parameter validation was performed in vmware-vga driver in rectangle handling functionality.
 bits\_per\_pixel that are less than 8 could result in accessing non-initialized buffers later in the code due to the expectation that bytes\_per\_pixel value that is used to initialize these buffers is never zero.
