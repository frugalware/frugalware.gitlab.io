A security issue has been reported in phpMyAdmin, which can be exploited by malicious users to bypass certain security restrictions.
The security issue is caused due to an error within the handling of bookmarked SQL queries, which can be exploited to e.g. trick other users into executing unintended bookmarked SQL queries.
