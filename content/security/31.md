Will Drewry has reported some vulnerabilities in Cscope, which potentially can be exploited by malicious people to compromise a vulnerable system.
 1) Various boundary errors within the parsing of file lists or the expansion of environment variables can be exploited to cause stack-based buffer overflows when parsing specially crafted "cscope.lists" files or directories.
 2) A boundary error within the parsing of command line arguments can be exploited to cause a stack-based buffer overflow when supplying an overly long "reffile" argument.
