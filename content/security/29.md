Adam Boileau has reported a vulnerability in Asterisk, which can be exploited by malicious people to cause a DoS (Denial of Service) and potentially compromise a vulnerable system.
 The vulnerability is caused due to an integer overflow within the "get\_input()" function in chan\_skinny.c. This can be exploited to cause a heap-based buffer overflow by sending specially crafted packets to the Asterisk Skinny channel driver.
 Successful exploitation may allow the execution of arbitrary code, but requires that "chan\_skinny" is loaded.
