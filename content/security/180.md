Alex Yamauchi has reported a weakness in XScreenSaver, which potentially can be exploited by malicious people to bypass certain security restrictions.
 The weakness is caused due to an error within the parsing of results of a call to "getpwuid()" in drivers/lock.c when using directory servers during a network outage. This can be exploited to e.g. crash XScreenSaver and thus gain access to a locked system.
