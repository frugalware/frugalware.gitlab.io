Some vulnerabilities have been reported in ImageMagick, which can be exploited by malicious people to cause a DoS (Denial of Service) and potentially compromise a vulnerable system.
 1) A boundary error within the "ReadDCMImage()" function in coders/dcm.c can be exploited to cause a buffer overflow when processing specially crafted DCM images.
 2) Several boundary errors within the "ReadPALMImage()" function in coders/palm.c can be exploited to cause heap-based buffer overflows when processing specially crafted PALM images.
 Successful exploitation may allow the execution of arbitrary code.
