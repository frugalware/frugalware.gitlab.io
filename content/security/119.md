A vulnerability has been reported in RARLabs UnRAR, which can be exploited by malicious people to compromise a user's system.
 The vulnerability is caused due to a boundary error when processing password-protected archives using the UnRAR command line utility. This can be exploited to cause a stack-based buffer overflow via a specially crafted password-protected archive.
 Successful exploitation requires that the user is e.g. tricked into opening a password-protected archive and respond to the password prompt.
