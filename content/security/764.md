Anton Johansson discovered that an invalid TLS handshake package could crash OpenSSL with a NULL pointer dereference.
 Multiple security issues have been fixed in OpenSSL: The TLS 1.2 support was susceptible to denial of service and retransmission of DTLS messages was fixed.
 In addition this update disables the insecure Dual\_EC\_DRBG algorithm and no longer uses the RdRand feature available on some Intel CPUs as a sole source of entropy unless explicitly requested.
