Some vulnerabilities have been reported in Wireshark, which can be exploited by malicious people to cause a DoS (Denial of Service) or potentially compromise a user's system.
 1) A boundary error in the Daintree SNA file parser can be exploited to cause a buffer overflow via a specially crafted capture file.
 Successful exploitation may allow execution of arbitrary code.
 2) An error in the IPMI dissector on Windows can be exploited to cause a crash.
 3) An error in the SMB and SMB2 dissectors can be exploited to cause a crash.
