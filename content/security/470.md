* Vulnerable: 1.4.0-1
* Unaffected: 1.4.0-2kalgan1


Secunia Research has discovered two vulnerabilities in imlib2, which can be exploited by malicious people to cause a DoS (Denial of Service) or compromise an application using the library.
 1) A boundary error exists within the "load()" function in src/modules/loaders/loader\_pnm.c when processing the header of a PNM image file. This can be exploited to cause a stack-based buffer overflow by e.g. tricking a user into opening a specially crafted PNM image in an application using the imlib2 library.
 Successful exploitation allows execution of arbitrary code.
 2) A boundary error exists within the "load()" function in src/modules/loader\_xpm.c when processing an XPM image file. This can be exploited to cause a stack-based buffer overflow by e.g. tricking a user into opening a specially crafted XPM image in an application using the imlib2 library.
 Successful exploitation may allow execution of arbitrary code.
