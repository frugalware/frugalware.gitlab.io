* Unaffected: 1.2.7-2terminus1


Some vulnerabilities have been reported in X.Org X11, which potentially can be exploited by malicious, local users to disclose sensitive information, cause a DoS (Denial of Service), and gain escalated privileges.
 1) An integer overflow exists within the parsing of BDF fonts. This can be exploited to cause a heap-based buffer overflow via a specially crafted BDF font. Successful exploitation may allow the execution of arbitrary code with escalated privileges.
 2) An integer overflow exists within the parsing of the "fonts.dir" fonts information file. This can be exploited to cause a heap-based buffer overflow via a specially crafted fonts information file that specifies an element count of more than 1,073,741,824 in the first line. Successful exploitation may allow the execution of arbitrary code with escalated privileges.
 3) An input validation error exists within the "ProcXCMiscGetXIDList()" function of the XC-MISC extension. This can be exploited to cause a stack-based (if the "alloca()" function is available) or heap-based memory corruption by passing specially crafted parameters to the function. Successful exploitation may allow the execution of arbitrary code with escalated privileges.
 4) An integer overflow exists within the "XGetPixel()" function in ImUtil.c. This can be exploited to cause a crash or disclose potentially sensitive information by passing specially crafted parameters to the function.
