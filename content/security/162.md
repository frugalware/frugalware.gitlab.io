Some vulnerabilities have been reported in phpMyAdmin, which can be exploited by malicious people to conduct cross-site scripting attacks.
 Input passed to the "fieldkey" parameter in browse\_foreigners.php and input passed to the "PMA\_sanitize()" function is not properly sanitised before being returned to the user. This can be exploited to execute arbitrary HTML and script code in a user's browser session in context of an affected site.
