A security issue has been reported in Amarok, which can be exploited by malicious, local users to perform certain actions with escalated privileges.
 The security issue is caused due to the "MagnatuneBrowser::listDownloadComplete()" function handling temporary files in an insecure manner. This can be exploited via symlink attacks in combination with a race condition to overwrite arbitrary files with the privileges of the user running the application.
