An unauthenticated remote attacker with the ability to inject packets into a legitimately established GSSAPI application session can cause a program crash due to invalid memory references when attempting to read beyond the end of a buffer.
 An unauthenticated remote attacker with the ability to inject packets into a legitimately established GSSAPI application session can cause a program crash due to invalid memory references when reading beyond the end of a buffer or by causing a null pointer dereference.
 An unauthenticated remote attacker with the ability to spoof packets appearing to be from a GSSAPI acceptor can cause a double-free condition in GSSAPI initiators (clients) which are using the SPNEGO mechanism, by returning a different underlying mechanism than was proposed by the initiator.
 An unauthenticated or partially authenticated remote attacker can cause a NULL dereference and application crash during a SPNEGO negotiation by sending an empty token as the second or later context token from initiator to acceptor.
 When kadmind is configured to use LDAP for the KDC database, an authenticated remote attacker can cause it to perform an out-of-bounds write (buffer overflow).
