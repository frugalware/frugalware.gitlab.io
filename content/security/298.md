A vulnerability has been discovered in PWLib, which can be exploited by malicious people to cause a DoS (Denial of Service).
 The vulnerability is caused due to an error within the "PString::vsprintf()" method in src/ptlib/common/contain.cxx. This can be exploited to cause a memory corruption by e.g. tricking an application using the library to use this function with a string longer than 1000 bytes.
