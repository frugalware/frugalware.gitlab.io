Hendrik-Jan Verheij has discovered a vulnerability in Joomla!, which can be exploited by malicious people to compromise a vulnerable system.
 Input passed to the "mosConfig\_absolute\_path" parameter in index.php is not properly verified before being used to include files. This can be exploited to include arbitrary files from external resources.
 Successful exploitation requires that RG\_EMULATION is either switched on or undefined.
 NOTE: Both situations cause security warnings to be displayed in Joomla!'s administration section.
