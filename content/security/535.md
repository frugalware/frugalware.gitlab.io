A weakness and two vulnerabilities have been reported in lighttpd, which can be exploited by malicious people to disclose potentially sensitive information, bypass certain security restrictions, and cause a DoS (Denial of Service).
 1) A vulnerability is caused due to a memory leak within the "http\_request\_parse()" function when processing duplicate request headers and can be exploited to exhaust all available memory.
 2) A vulnerability is caused due to the "mod\_userdir" module not correctly handling filenames on case insensitive file systems. This can be exploited to e.g. disclose potentially sensitive information by sending requests with mixed upper and lowercase characters.
 3) A weakness is caused due to lighttpd not decoding requests before matching them with rewrite and redirect rules. This can be exploited to e.g. bypass the rewrite and redirect rules.
