A vulnerability has been reported in BIND, which can be exploited by malicious people to cause a DoS (Denial of Service).
 The vulnerability is caused due to an error when invoking the "query\_addsoa()" function. This can be exploited to cause the nameserver to exit by sending a specially crafted sequence of queries.
 Successful exploitation requires that "recursion" is enabled.
