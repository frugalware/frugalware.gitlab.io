Two vulnerabilities and a weakness have been reported in the Linux Kernel, which can be exploited by malicious, local users to disclose potentially sensitive information and malicious people to cause a DoS (Denial of Service).
 1) A NULL-pointer dereference exists within netfilter when handling new SCTP connections with unknown chunk types. This can be exploited to crash the kernel by sending malicious packets.
 2) An underflow error within the "cpuset\_task\_read()" function in /kernel/cpuset.c can be exploited to read kernel memory, which may contain potentially sensitive information. Successful exploitation requires that the attacker has access to open the /dev/cpuset/tasks file (the cpuset file system needs to be mounted).
 3) The kernel does not handle seeds for the random number generator correctly. This may weaken the security of applications relying on the randomness of the kernel random number generator.
