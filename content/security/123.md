Moshe BA has reported a vulnerability in MediaWiki, which can be exploited by malicious people to conduct cross-site scripting attacks.
 Input passed to the "rs" parameter in index.php (when "action" is set to "ajax") is not properly sanitised from UTF-7 data before being returned to the user. This can be exploited to execute arbitrary HTML and script code in a user's browser session in context of an affected site.
 Successful exploitation requires that $wgUseAjax is set to true (not default setting) and that the target user uses Internet Explorer with encoding auto-detection enabled.
