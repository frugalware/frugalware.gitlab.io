* Vulnerable: 1.3.6-2kalgan1
* Unaffected: 1.3.6-2kalgan2


Thomas Pollet has reported a vulnerability in CUPS, which potentially can be exploited by malicious people to compromise a vulnerable system.
 The vulnerability is caused due to two integer overflow errors in filter/image-png.c when processing PNG files. These can be exploited to cause a heap-based buffer overflow via overly large width and height PNG fields.
 Successful exploitation may allow execution of arbitrary code.
