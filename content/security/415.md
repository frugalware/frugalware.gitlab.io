A vulnerability and a security issue have been reported in GNU M4, which can be exploited by malicious people to manipulate certain data or to potentially compromise a user's system.
 1) A format string error exists within the "produce\_frozen\_state()" function in src/freeze.c. This can be exploited via a specially crafted filename passed as a parameter to "m4 -F".
 Successful exploitation may allow execution of arbitrary code, but requires that the user is tricked into processing a filename containing malicious format specifiers.
 2) An error within the implementation of the "maketemp" and "mkstemp" macros can potentially be exploited to trigger the processing of improper files via special characters contained in the output string.
