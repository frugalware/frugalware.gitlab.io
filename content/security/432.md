* Vulnerable: 0.92.1-1
* Unaffected: 0.93-1kalgan1


Some vulnerabilities have been reported in ClamAV, which can be exploited by malicious people to bypass certain security restrictions, to cause a DoS (Denial of Service), or to compromise a vulnerable system.
 1) A boundary error exists within the "cli\_scanpe()" function in libclamav/pe.c. This can be exploited to cause a heap-based buffer overflow via a specially crafted "Upack" executable.
 Successful exploitation allows execution of arbitrary code.
 2) A boundary error within the processing of PeSpin packed executables in libclamav/spin.c can be exploited to cause a heap-based buffer overflow.
 Successful exploitation may allow execution of arbitrary code.
 3) An unspecified error in the processing of ARJ files can be exploited to hang ClamAV.
 4) A boundary error within the processing of WWPack packed PE files in libclamav/pe.c can be exploited to cause a heap corruption.
 Successful exploitation may allow execution of arbitrary code.
 5) An error in the processing of RAR files can be exploited to bypass the scanning mechanism via a RAR file containing an invalid version number.
 6) An error exists within the "rfc2231()" function in message.c. This can be exploited to trigger the return of strings that are not NULL terminated and cause a crash.
 7) An error in libclamunrar can be exploited to crash the application via specially crafted RAR files.
