Some vulnerabilities have been reported in phpMyAdmin, which can be exploited by malicious people to conduct cross-site scripting attacks and HTTP response splitting attacks.
 1) Input passed to unspecified parameters is not properly sanitised before being returned to the user. This can be exploited to execute arbitrary HTML and script code in a user's browser session in context of an affected site.
 2) Input passed in the "phpMyAdmin" cookie is not properly sanitised before being returned to the user. This can be exploited to insert arbitrary HTTP headers, which will be included in a response sent to the user, allowing for execution of arbitrary HTML and script code in a user's browser session in context of an affected site.
 Successful exploitation of this vulnerability requires a version of PHP 4 before 4.4.2 or a version of PHP 5 before 5.1.2.
