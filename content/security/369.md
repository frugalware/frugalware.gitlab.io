A vulnerability has been reported in the Linux Kernel, which can be exploited by malicious, local users to cause a DoS (Denial of Service), disclose potentially sensitive information, and gain escalated privileges.
 The vulnerability is caused due to the missing verification of parameters within the "vmsplice\_to\_user()", "copy\_from\_user\_mmap\_sem()", and "get\_iovec\_page\_array()" functions in fs/splice.c before using them to perform certain memory operations. This can be exploited to e.g. read or write to arbitrary kernel memory via a specially crafted "vmsplice()" system call.
 Successful exploitation allows attackers to e.g. gain "root" privileges.
