A vulnerability has been reported in WordPress, which can be exploited by malicious people to cause a DoS (Denial of Service).
 The vulnerability is caused due to the wp-trackback.php script letting users pass multiple source character encodings to the "mb\_convert\_encoding()" function, which can be used to cause a high CPU load, potentially resulting in a DoS.
