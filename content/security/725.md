Multiple vulnerabilities have been reported in Wireshark, which can be exploited by malicious people to cause a DoS (Denial of Service).
 1) An error in the DICOM dissector can be exploited to cause an infinite loop when processing certain malformed packets.
 2) An error when processing a Diameter dictionary file can be exploited to cause the process to crash.
 3) An error when processing a snoop file can be exploited to cause the process to crash.
 4) An error when processing compressed capture data can be exploited to cause the process to crash.
 5) An error when processing a Visual Networks file can be exploited to cause the process to crash.
 6) An error in the "desegment\_tcp()" function (epan/dissectors/packet-tcp.c) when handling certain TCP segments can be exploited to dereference a NULL pointer and crash the process.
