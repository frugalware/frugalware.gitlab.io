Stefan Esser has discovered a vulnerability in Opera, which can be exploited by malicious people to conduct cross-site scripting attacks.
 The vulnerability exist because pages that do not specify a charset inherit the charset of the parent page. This can be exploited to execute arbitrary HTML and script code in a user's browser session in context of certain sites that are included e.g. via iframes in a malicious page that uses UTF-7 as charset.
 Successful exploitation requires that the user is tricked into visiting a malicious web site.
 A vulnerability with an unknown impact has been reported in Opera. The vulnerability is caused due to an unspecified error when using the Adobe Flash Player plug-in.
 The vulnerability is reported in Opera versions prior to 9.20 running on Linux, Solaris, or FreeBSD and using the Adobe Flash Player version 7 or 9.
