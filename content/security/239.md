David Thiel has reported some vulnerabilities in libvorbis, which can be exploited by malicious people to cause a DoS (Denial of Service) and potentially compromise an application using the library.
 1) A boundary error exists in the way the "\_01inverse()" function in res.c processes "blocksize\_0" and "blocksize\_1" values, which can be exploited to cause a heap overwrite.
 2) A boundary error exists in the way the "vorbis\_info\_clear()" function in info.c processes invalid mapping types, which can be exploited to trigger a call to a value outside the dispatch table.
 3) Invalid "blocksize" values passed to the "vorbis\_dsp\_clear()" function in block.c result in an invalid memory access, which can be exploited to cause a DoS.
