Some vulnerabilities have been reported in Mozilla Firefox, which can be exploited by malicious, local users to potentially disclose sensitive information, and by malicious people to conduct cross-site scripting attacks, bypass certain security restrictions, disclose sensitive information, or potentially to compromise a user's system.
 1) Multiple errors in the layout engine can be exploited to cause memory corruptions and potentially execute arbitrary code.
 2) Multiple errors in the Javascript engine can be exploited to cause memory corruptions and potentially execute arbitrary code.
 3) A chrome XBL method can be used in combination with "window.eval" to execute arbitrary Javascript code in the context of another web site
 4) An error when restoring a closed tab can be exploited to modify an input control's text value, which allows e.g. to disclose the content of a local file when a user re-opens a tab.
 5) An error in the processing of shortcut files can be exploited to execute arbitrary script code with chrome privileges e.g. via an HTML file that loads a privileged chrome document via a .desktop shortcut file.
 6) A security issue is caused due to cookies marked "HTTPOnly" being readable by Javascript via the "XMLHttpRequest.getResponseHeader" and "XMLHttpRequest.getAllResponseHeaders" APIs.
 7) A security issue is caused due to Firefox ignoring certain HTTP directives to not cache web pages ("Cache-Control: no-store" and "Cache-Control: no-cache" for HTTPS pages), which can be exploited to disclose potentially sensitive information via cached pages.
