Two vulnerabilities have been reported in the Firebug extension for Mozilla Firefox, which can be exploited by malicious people to compromise a vulnerable system.
 1) Input passed to the "console.log()" function is not properly sanitised and can be exploited to e.g. execute arbitrary script code within the "chrome:" context by tricking a user into visiting a malicious website.
 2) Results of the "toString" method when processing function objects are not properly sanitised before being used. This can be exploited to e.g. execute arbitrary script code within the "chrome:" context by overriding the "toString" method with a specially crafted function.
