A vulnerability has been discovered in Sun Java, which can be exploited by malicious people to compromise a user's system.
 The vulnerability is caused due to an input sanitation error in the Java Deployment Toolkit browser plugin. This can be exploited to pass arbitrary arguments to javaw.exe and e.g. execute a JAR file placed on a network share in a privileged context.
 Successful exploitation allows execution of arbitrary code by tricking a user into visiting a malicious web page.
