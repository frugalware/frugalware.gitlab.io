Some vulnerabilities have been reported in Mozilla Thunderbird, which potentially can be exploited by malicious people to compromise a user's system.
 1) An integer overflow within the handling of emails formatted as text/richtext or text/enhanced may be exploited to execute arbitrary code, but requires that a malicious email includes a 400 megabyte long line.
 2) An integer underflow error in the Network Security Services (NSS) code when processing SSLv2 server messages can be exploited to cause a heap-based buffer overflow via a certificate with a public key too small to encrypt the "Master Secret". Successful exploitation may allow execution of arbitrary code.
 3) Multiple memory corruption errors exist in the layout engine, JavaScript engine, and in SVG. Some of these may be exploited to execute arbitrary code on a user's system.
