1) The personality subsystem in the Linux kernel before 2.6.31-rc3 has a PER\_CLEAR\_ON\_SETID setting that does not clear the ADDR\_COMPAT\_LAYOUT and MMAP\_PAGE\_ZERO flags when executing a setuid or setgid program, which makes it easier for local users to leverage the details of memory usage to (1) conduct NULL pointer dereference attacks, (2) bypass the mmap\_min\_addr protection mechanism, or (3) defeat address space layout randomization (ASLR).
 2) Stack-based buffer overflow in the parse\_tag\_11\_packet function in fs/ecryptfs/keystore.c in the eCryptfs subsystem in the Linux kernel before 2.6.30.4 allows local users to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly gain privileges via vectors involving a crafted eCryptfs file, related to not ensuring that the key signature length in a Tag 11 packet is compatible with the key signature buffer size. 
 3) Heap-based buffer overflow in the parse\_tag\_3\_packet function in fs/ecryptfs/keystore.c in the eCryptfs subsystem in the Linux kernel before 2.6.30.4 allows local users to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly gain privileges via vectors involving a crafted eCryptfs file, related to a large encrypted key size in a Tag 3 packet.
