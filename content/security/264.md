Lasse Karkkainen has reported a security issue in Xfce Terminal, which can be exploited by malicious people to inject shell commands.
 The "terminal\_helper\_execute()" function in terminal/terminal.c uses "/bin/sh -c" to spawn the browser process. This can be used to disclose sensitive information or execute shell commands by e.g. tricking a user into opening a malicious link using the "Open Link" functionality.
