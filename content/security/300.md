Omer Singer has reported two vulnerabilities in phpMyAdmin, which can be exploited by malicious people to conduct cross-site scripting attacks.
 1) Input passed via the URL is not properly sanitised before being returned to the user. This can be exploited to execute arbitrary HTML and script code in a user's browser session in context of an affected site. Successful exploitation requires that the user is running a browser that has not URL-encoded the request (e.g. Internet Explorer 6).
 2) Input passed in the URL to server\_status.php is not properly sanitised before being returned to the user. This can be exploited to execute arbitrary HTML and script code in a user's browser session in context of an affected site. Successful exploitation requires that the target user has valid user credentials. NOTE: Some other potential cross-site scripting problems have also been fixed by the vendor.
