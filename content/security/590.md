Some vulnerabilities have been reported in Wireshark, which can potentially be exploited by malicious people to cause a DoS (Denial of Service) and compromise a user's system.
 1) A vulnerability is caused due to a format string error within the PN-DCP dissector when processing station names containing format string specifiers. This can be exploited to cause a crash and potentially execute arbitrary code via specially crafted packets captured off the wire or loaded via a capture file.
 2) An error within the Check Point High-Availability Protocol (CPHAP) dissector can be exploited to cause a crash.
