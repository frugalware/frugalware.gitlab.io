Some vulnerabilities have been reported in PostgreSQL, which can be exploited by malicious users to gain escalated privileges or to cause a DoS (Denial of Service).
 1) Index functions are executed as superuser during "VACUUM" and "ANALYZE", which can be exploited to gain escalated privileges.
 2) "SET ROLE" and "SET SESSION AUTHORIZATION" are permitted within index functions, which can be exploited to gain escalated privileges.
 3) Various errors in the processing of regular expressions within SQL queries can be exploited to cause infinite loops, consume large amounts of memory, or to crash the backend, resulting in a DoS.
 4) Errors in the DBLink module can be exploited to gain superuser privileges when being used in combination with local trust or ident authentication.
