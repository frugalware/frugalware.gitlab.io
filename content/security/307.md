Jab Oravec has reported a security issue in Tomboy, which can be exploited by malicious, local users to gain escalated privileges.
 The security issue is caused due to the "/usr/bin/tomboy" script incorrectly setting the environment variable LD\_LIBRARY\_PATH. This can be exploited to gain escalated privileges by e.g. tricking a user into running Tomboy in a directory containing a malicious library.
