Some vulnerabilities have been reported in MadWifi, which can be exploited by malicious, local users and malicious people to cause a DoS (Denial of Service).
 1) A division by zero error exists within the function "ath\_beacon\_config()". This can be exploited to cause a crash by sending a packet with a zero beacon interval to a vulnerable system.
 2) An input sanitation error exists within the IO control "ieee80211\_ioctl\_getwmmparams". This can be exploited to crash the kernel by calling the IO control with a negative index parameter. This may also allow certain parts of the memory to be disclosed.
 3) An input sanitation error exist within the packet parser when parsing nested 802.3 Ethernet frame lengths. This can be exploited to cause a NULL pointer dereference by sending a specially crafted fast frame packet to a vulnerable system.
