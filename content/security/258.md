A vulnerability has been reported in the Apache mod\_proxy module, which can be exploited by malicious people to cause a DoS (Denial of Service).
 The vulnerability is caused due to the improper handling of date headers within the "ap\_proxy\_date\_canon()" function in proxy\_util.c. This can be exploited to cause a DoS by sending specially crafted requests to the affected server.
 Successful exploitation results in a crash if a threaded Multi-Processing Module is used on servers where a reverse or forward proxy is configured.
