A vulnerability has been reported in the Linux Kernel, which can be exploited by malicious, local users to bypass certain security restrictions.
 The vulnerability is caused due to the ReiserFS file system implementation not properly restricting access to the ".reiserfs\_priv" directory, which can be exploited to e.g. gain root privileges by modifying ACLs or extended attributes.
 Successful exploitation requires that the ReiserFS file system is used.
