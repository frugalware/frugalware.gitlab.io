Some vulnerabilities have been reported in SquirrelMail, which can be exploited by malicious people to conduct cross-site scripting and script insertion attacks.
 1) Input passed to certain parameters in webmail.php and compose.php in the "draft", "compose", and "mailto" functionality is not properly sanitised before being returned to the user. This can be exploited to execute arbitrary HTML and script code in a user's browser session in context of an affected site.
 2) Input validation errors exist in the magicHTML filter when sanitising HTML mails. This can be exploited to insert arbitrary HTML and script code, which is executed in a user's browser session in context of an affected site when the malicious data is viewed.
 Successful exploitation of some of these errors require that the target user runs Microsoft Internet Explorer.
