Chris Evans has reported a vulnerability in Ghostscript, which can be exploited by malicious people to compromise a user's system.
 The vulnerability is caused due to a boundary error within the "zseticcspace()" function in zicc.c. This can be exploited to cause a stack-based buffer overflow via an overly large "Range" array.
 Successful exploitation allows execution of arbitrary code.
