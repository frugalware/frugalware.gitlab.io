Some vulnerabilities have been discovered in GNU Enscript, which can be exploited by malicious people to compromise a vulnerable system.
 1) A vulnerability is caused due to a boundary error within the "read\_special\_escape()" function in src/psgen.c when processing the "setfilename" escape sequence. This can be exploited to cause a stack-based buffer overflow by tricking the user into converting a malicious file.
 2) A vulnerability is caused due to a boundary error within the "read\_special\_escape()" function in src/psgen.c when processing the "font" escape sequence. This can be exploited to cause a stack-based buffer overflow by tricking the user into converting a malicious file.
 Successful exploitation allows execution of arbitrary code, but requires that special escapes processing is enabled with the "-e" option.
