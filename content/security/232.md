* Vulnerable: 1.3.1-2
* Unaffected: 1.3.1-3terminus1


Some vulnerabilities have been reported in libarchive, which can be exploited by malicious people to cause a DoS (Denial of Service) or potentially compromise an application using the library.
 The vulnerabilities are caused due to a NULL pointer dereference, an infinite loop, and a buffer overflow when processing certain malformed pax extension headers. These can be exploited to crash an application, cause a high CPU load or potentially execute arbitrary code by tricking a user or automated system to process a specially crafted archive file with an application using the library.
