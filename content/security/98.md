Alfredo Ortega has reported a vulnerability in the mod\_ctrls module for ProFTPD, which can be exploited by malicious, local users to gain escalated privileges.
 The vulnerability is caused due to a boundary error within the "pr\_ctrls\_recv\_request()" function in src/ctrls.c and can be exploited to cause a buffer overflow by sending specially crafted control messages to the module.
 Successful exploitation may allow to execute arbitrary code with escalated privileges, but requires that the mod\_ctrl module is used and that ACLs allow the attacker to access the module.
