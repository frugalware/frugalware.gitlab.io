Some vulnerabilities have been reported in phpMyAdmin, which can be exploited by malicious people to conduct cross-site scripting attacks or compromise a vulnerable system.
 1) Input passed via export page cookies is not properly sanitised before being returned to the user. This can be exploited to execute arbitrary HTML and script code in a user's browser session in the context of an affected site.
 2) The vulnerability is caused due to the application not properly sanitising configuration parameters during the setup procedure. This can be exploited to inject arbitrary PHP code into the phpMyAdmin configuration file.
 NOTE: Successful exploitation of this vulnerability requires that installation best-practices have not been followed and the setup scripts have not been deleted after a successful installation.
