Ben Hutchings discovered the following security weaknesses in the utility programs:
 Due to insufficient sanitation, smb4k\_mount allowed an user to mount any (local) device if the program was used in combination with sudo or super.
 The function findprog(), which was in present smb4k\_mount, smb4k\_umount, and smb4k\_kill, returned a pointer to memory that was freed when the function exited.
 The function replace\_special\_characters(), that was present in smb4k\_mount and smb4k\_umount, returned a pointer to memory that was freed after the function exited. Additionally, it didn't replace the hyphen.
