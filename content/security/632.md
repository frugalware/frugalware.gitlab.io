Some vulnerabilities have been reported in Wireshark, which can be exploited by malicious people to cause a DoS (Denial of Service).
 1) An alignment error within the "dissect\_paltalk()" function in epan/dissectors/packet-paltalk.c of the Paltalk dissector can be exploited to cause a crash.
 Note: Successful exploitation requires that Wireshark is running on an alignment sensitive architecture.
 2) A NULL pointer dereference error within the DCERPC/NT dissector when can be exploited to cause a crash.
 3) An off-by-one error within the "dissect\_negprot\_response()" function in epan/dissectors/packet-smb.c of the SMB dissector can be exploited to cause a crash.
 4) An error within the RADIUS dissector can be exploited to cause a crash.
