Some vulnerabilities have been reported in MPlayer, which can be exploited by malicious people to compromise a user's system.
 1) A boundary error exists within the libmpdemux/demux\_audio.c file when parsing FLAC comments. This can be exploited to corrupt memory via a specially crafted FLAC file.
 2) An array indexing error exists within the libmpdemux/demux\_mov.c file when parsing MOV file headers. This can be exploited to corrupt heap memory via a specially crafted MOV file.
 3) A boundary error exists within the "url\_scape\_string()" function in stream/url.c. This can be exploited to cause a buffer overflow via a specially crafted URL.
 4) A boundary error exists within the "cddb\_parse\_matches\_list()" and "cddb\_query\_parse()" functions in stream/stream\_cddb.c. This can be exploited to cause a stack-based buffer overflow via an overly long album title received from a CDDB server.
 Successful exploitation allows execution of arbitrary code.
