A security issue and two vulnerabilities have been reported in MySQL, which can be exploited by malicious users to gain escalated privileges, manipulate certain data, or to cause a DoS (Denial of Service).
 1) A security issue exists due to the command "ALTER VIEW" retaining the original "DEFINER" value, which may allow another user to gain the access rights of the view.
 2) An error in the FEDERATED engine when handling responses of remote servers can be exploited to crash the local server when the response contains fewer columns than expected.
 3) An error when renaming a table can be exploited by malicious users to manipulate certain data.
