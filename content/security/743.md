Some vulnerabilities have been reported in MantisBT, which can be exploited by malicious people to conduct cross-site scripting attacks and disclose potentially sensitive information and by malicious users to compromise a vulnerable system.

1) Certain input passed via the URL is not properly sanitised before being returned to the user. This can be exploited to execute arbitrary HTML and script code in a user's browser session in context of an affected site.

2) Input passed to the "action" parameter in bug\_actiongroup\_ext\_page.php and bug\_actiongroup\_page.php is not properly verified before being used to include files. This can be exploited to include arbitrary files from local resources via directory traversal attacks and URL-encoded NULL bytes.

Note: In combination with MantisBT's file upload functionality, this can be exploited to execute arbitrary PHP code.

3) Input passed to the "os", "os\_build", and "platform" parameters in bug\_report\_page.php and bug\_update\_advanced\_page.php is not properly sanitised before being returned to the user. This can be exploited to execute arbitrary HTML and script code in a users browser session in context of an affected site.
