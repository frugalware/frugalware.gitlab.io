Tobias Klein has reported a vulnerability in FFmpeg, which potentially can be exploited by malicious people to compromise an application using the library.
 The vulnerability is caused due to a signedness error within the "fourxm\_read\_header()" function in libavformat/4xm.c. This can be exploited to corrupt arbitrary memory via a specially crafted 4xm file.
 Successful exploitation may allow execution of arbitrary code.
