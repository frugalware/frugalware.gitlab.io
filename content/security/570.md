Roee Hay has discovered a vulnerability in Graphviz, which can be exploited by malicious people to compromise a user's system.
 The vulnerability is caused due to a boundary error within the "push\_subg()" function in lib/graph/parser.c, which can be exploited to cause a memory corruption and potentially execute arbitrary code by e.g. tricking a user into processing a specially crafted dot file.
