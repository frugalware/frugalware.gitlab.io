* Vulnerable: 2.2.8-1
* Unaffected: 2.2.8-2kalgan1


A vulnerability has been reported in the Apache mod\_proxy module, which potentially can be exploited by malicious people to cause a DoS (Denial of Service).
 The vulnerability is caused due to an error in the "ap\_proxy\_http\_process\_response()" function when forwarding interim responses. This can be exploited to consume large amounts of memory by tricking mod\_proxy into sending an overly large number of interim responses to the client.
