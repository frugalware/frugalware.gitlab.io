Gjoko Krstic has reported some vulnerabilities in MantisBT, which can be exploited by malicious people to conduct cross-site scripting attacks and disclose sensitive information.
 1) Input passed via the "db\_type" parameter to admin/upgrade\_unattended.php is not properly sanitised before being returned to the user. This can be exploited to execute arbitrary HTML and script code in a user's browser session in context of an affected site.
 2) Input passed via the "db\_type" parameter to admin/upgrade\_unattended.php is not properly verified before being used to include files. This can be exploited to include arbitrary file from local resources via directory traversal sequences and URL-encoded NULL bytes.
 NOTE: Successful exploitation requires that installation best-practices have not been followed and the "admin" directory has not been deleted after a successful installation.
