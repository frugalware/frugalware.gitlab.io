* Vulnerable: 1.2.0-1
* Unaffected: 1.2.0-2kalgan1


Some vulnerabilities have been reported in libvorbis, which can be exploited by malicious people to cause a DoS (Denial of Service) and potentially to compromise an application using the library.
 1) An input validation error can be exploited to crash an application, cause an infinite loop, or to cause a heap overflow via a specially crafted OGG file containing a codebook dimension of "0".
 2) An integer overflow error in the processing of residue partition values can be exploited to cause a heap-based buffer overflow via a specially crafted OGG file.
 3) An integer overflow error exists in the computation of "quantvals" and of required space for "quantlist". This can be exploited to cause a heap-based buffer overflow via a specially crafted OGG file.
 Successful exploitation may allow execution of arbitrary code.
