John Heasman has reported some vulnerabilities in OpenOffice, which can be exploited by malicious people to compromise a user's system.
 1) A truncation error within the handling of the META\_ESCAPE record can be exploited to cause a heap-based buffer overflow via a specially crafted WMF/EMF file.
 2) An integer overflow within the handling of EMR\_POLYPOLYGON and EMR\_POLYPOLYGON16 records can be exploited to cause a heap-based buffer overflow via a specially crafted WMF/EMF file.
 Successful exploitation of the vulnerabilities allows execution of arbitrary code and requires that a user is tricked into opening a specially crafted WMF/EMF file or a specially crafted document.
