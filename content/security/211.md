A vulnerability has been reported in libexif, which can be exploited by malicious people to cause a DoS (Denial of Service) and potentially compromise an application using the library.
 The vulnerability is caused due to an integer overflow error within the "exif\_data\_load\_data\_entry()" function when handling EXIF component information and can be exploited to cause a heap based buffer overflow.
 Successful exploitation may allow an attacker to crash an application using the library or to execute arbitrary code.
