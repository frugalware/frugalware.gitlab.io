Bernhard R. Link has reported a security issue in rxvt, which can be exploited by malicious, local users to gain escalated privileges.
 The security issue is caused due to the program using ":0" as it's X11 display if the DISPLAY environment variable is missing. This can be exploited to execute arbitrary commands with the privileges of the user running rxvt via a malicious X server.
