It was found that foomatic-rip filter used insecurely created temporary file
for storage of PostScript data by rendering the data, intended to be sent to
the PostScript filter, when the debug mode was enabled. A local attacker could
use this flaw to conduct symlink attacks (overwrite arbitrary file accessible
with the privileges of the user running the foomatic-rip universal print
filter).
