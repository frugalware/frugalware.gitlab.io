libdns allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (memory consumption) via a crafted regular expression, as demonstrated by a memory-exhaustion attack against a machine running a named process.
 Maxim Shudrak and the HP Zero Day Initiative reported a denial of service vulnerability in BIND, a DNS server. A specially crafted query that includes malformed rdata can cause named daemon to terminate with an assertion failure while rejecting the malformed query.
