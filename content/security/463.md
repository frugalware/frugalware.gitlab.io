* Vulnerable: 0.9.8-11
* Unaffected: 0.9.8-12kalgan1


Two vulnerabilities have been reported in OpenSSL, which can be exploited by malicious people to cause a DoS (Denial of Service).
 1) A double-free error in the handling of server name extension data if "server\_name" set to 0x00 can be exploited to crash a server application using OpenSSL by sending a specially crafted TLS 1.0 Client Hello packet.
 Successful exploitation requires that OpenSSL is compiled using the TLS server name extensions.
 2) A NULL pointer dereference error can be exploited by a malicious server to crash a client application when the "Server Key exchange message" is omitted from a TLS handshake and anonymous Diffie-Hellman key exchange is used.
