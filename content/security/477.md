* Vulnerable: 1.1.12-1kalgan1
* Unaffected: 1.1.14-1kalgan1


Some vulnerabilities have been reported in GraphicsMagick, which can be exploited by malicious people to cause a DoS (Denial of Service) or potentially compromise a vulnerable system.
 1) Two boundary errors exist within the "ReadPALMImage()" function in coders/palm.c. These can be exploited to cause a heap-based buffer underflow via a specially crafted PALM image.
 2) A boundary error exists within the "DecodeImage()" function in coders/pict.c. This can be exploited to cause a heap-based buffer overflow via a specially crafted PICT image.
 3) Multiple unspecified errors within the processing of XCF, DPX, and CINEON images can be exploited to crash the application.
 Successful exploitation may allow execution of arbitrary code.
