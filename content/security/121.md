Several vulnerabilities and a weakness have been reported in PHP, where some have unknown impacts and others can be exploited by malicious people to disclose potentially sensitive information, bypass certain security restrictions, cause a DoS (Denial of Service) and potentially compromise a vulnerable system.
 1) The "safe\_mode" and "open\_basedir" protection mechanisms can be bypassed via the session extension.
 2) Unspecified overflows can be exploited to cause a stack corruption in the session extension.
 3) Stack overflows exist in the "zip", "imap", and "sqlite" (PHP 5) extensions.
 4) A boundary error within the stream filters can be exploited to cause a buffer overflow.
 5) An integer overflow exists in the "str\_replace()" function. This can be exploited to trigger an error when allocating memory and potentially allows the execution of arbitrary code, if the function is used on long, untrusted strings.
 6) An unspecified error when importing malicious WDDX data can be exploited to disclose random heap memory.
 7) A format string error exists in the \*print() functions on 64-bit systems.
 8) Boundary errors exist within the "mail()" and the "ibase\_add\_user()", "ibase\_delete\_user()", and "ibase\_modify\_user()" functions and can be exploited to cause buffer overflows.
 9) A format string error exists in the "odbc\_result\_all()" function. Successful exploitation may allow the execution of arbitrary code, but requires that the attacker has control over the table contents of the used database.
 10) An error within the "imap\_mail\_compose()" function can be exploited to cause a heap based buffer overflow and may allow the execution of arbitrary code, if the function is used with untrusted input to create a new MIME message.
 11) A weakness within the "zend\_hash\_init()" function on 64bit systems can be exploited to cause a DoS via CPU consumption until the script times out by triggering an infinite loop when unserializing untrusted data.
