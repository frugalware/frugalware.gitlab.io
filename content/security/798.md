The spy\_user function which is called when a2ps is invoked with the --debug flag insecurely used temporary files.
 Brian M. Carlson reported that a2ps's fixps script does not invoke gs with the -dSAFER option. 
 Consequently executing fixps on a malicious PostScript file could result in files being deleted or arbitrary commands being executed with the privileges of the user running fixps.
