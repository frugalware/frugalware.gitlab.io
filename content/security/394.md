Some security issues have been reported in lighttpd, which can be exploited by malicious people to disclose potentially sensitive information.
 1) A security issue is caused due to an error in mod\_cgi, which can lead to the disclosure of source code when lighttpd is unable to fork.
 2) A security issue is caused due to the mod\_userdir module using "$HOME" by default if no userdir.path is set. This can be exploited to disclose the content of arbitrary files on certain systems via e.g. the "nobody" user.
