Tavis Ormandy and Will Drewry have reported a vulnerability in Perl, which potentially can be exploited by malicious people to compromise a vulnerable system.
 The vulnerability is caused due to a boundary error within the processing of regular expressions containing Unicode data. This can be exploited to cause a buffer overflow via a specially crafted regular expression causing a runtime switch to the Unicode character scheme.
