Evgeny Legerov has reported a vulnerability in the mod\_tls module for ProFTPD, which potentially can be exploited by malicious people to compromise a vulnerable system.
 The vulnerability is caused due to a boundary error within the "tls\_x509\_name\_oneline()" function in contrib/mod\_tls.c. This can be exploited to cause a buffer overflow by sending specially crafted data to a server.
 Successful exploitation may allow execution of arbitrary code, but requires that ProFTPD uses the mod\_tls module.
