Some vulnerabilities have been reported in Samba, which can be exploited by malicious people to compromise a vulnerable system.
 1) A boundary error exists within the "reply\_netbios\_packet()" function in nmbd/nmbd\_packets.c when sending NetBIOS replies. This can be exploited to cause a stack-based buffer overflow by sending multiple specially crafted WINS "Name Registration" requests followed by a WINS "Name Query" request. Successful exploitation allows execution of arbitrary code, but requires that Samba is configured to run as a WINS server (the "wins support" option is enabled).
 2) A boundary error exists within the processing of GETDC logon requests. This can be exploited to cause a buffer overflow by sending specially crafted GETDC mailslot requests. Successful exploitation of the vulnerability requires that Samba is configured as a Primary or Backup Domain Controller.
