Some vulnerabilities have been reported in ClamAV, which can be exploited by malicious people to cause a DoS (Denial of Service).
 1) An error exists within the OLE2 parser when handling objects with malformed FAT partitions and large property sizes. This can be exploited to cause a DoS due to storage and CPU resource consumption by scanning a specially crafted OLE2 file.
 2) An error in the processing of RAR files can be exploited to crash the process via a specially crafted RAR file.
 3) A boundary error exists within the file /libclamav/unsp.c, which can be exploited to crash the process via a specially crafted NsPacked file.
 4) An incorrect regular expression in libclamav/phishcheck.c can be exploited to cause a DoS by consuming all available CPU resources via a specially crafted file.
