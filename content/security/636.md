Some vulnerabilities have been reported in Wireshark, which can be exploited by malicious people to cause a DoS (Denial of Service) or compromise a user's system.
The vulnerabilities are caused due to errors within the LWRES dissector, which can be exploited to cause e.g. a stack-based buffer overflow via a specially crafted network packet or by tricking a user into loading a specially crafted capture file.
Successful exploitation allows execution of arbitrary code.
