A security issue and a vulnerability have been reported in WordPress, which can be exploited by malicious users to conduct script insertion attacks and compromise a vulnerable system.
 1) The security issue is caused due to the wp\_check\_filetype() function in /wp-includes/functions.php improperly validating uploaded files. This can be exploited to execute arbitrary PHP code by uploading a malicious PHP script with multiple extensions.
 Successful exploitation of this vulnerability requires that Apache is not configured to handle the mime-type for media files with an e.g. "gif", "jpg", "png", "tif", "wmv" extension.
 2) Input passed via certain parameters to press-this.php is not properly sanitised before being displayed to the user. This can be exploited to insert arbitrary HTML and script code, which will be executed in a user's browser session in context of an affected site when the malicious data is being viewed.
