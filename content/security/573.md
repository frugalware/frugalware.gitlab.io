Tobias Klein has reported a vulnerability in MPlayer, which potentially can be exploited by malicious people to compromise a user's system.
 The vulnerability is caused due to a boundary error within the "demux\_open\_vqf()" function in libmpdemux/demux\_vqf.c. This can be exploited to cause a stack-based buffer overflow via a specially crafted TwinVQ file.
 Successful exploitation may allow execution of arbitrary code.
