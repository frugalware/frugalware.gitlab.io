A vulnerability has been reported in Qt, which can potentially be exploited by malicious people to cause a DoS (Denial of Service) or to compromise an application using the library.
 The vulnerability is caused due to an off-by-one error within the "QUtf8Decoder::toUnicode()" function ("QUtf8Codec::convertToUnicode()" in Qt 4.x) in codecs/qutfcodec.cpp. This can be exploited to cause a one-byte heap-based buffer overflow via a specially crafted unicode string.
