A vulnerability has been reported in the Devel module for Drupal, which can be exploited by malicious users to conduct script insertion attacks.
 The variable editor does not properly sanitise the variable name before displaying it to the user. This can be exploited to insert arbitrary HTML and script code, which will be executed in a user's browser session in context of an affected site when the malicious data is being viewed.
