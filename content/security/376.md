Some vulnerabilities have been reported in ClamAV, which can be exploited by malicious people to cause a DoS (Denial of Service) or to potentially compromise a vulnerable system.
 1) An integer overflow error within the "cli\_scanpe()" function in libclamav/pe.c can be exploited to cause a heap-based buffer overflow via a specially crafted PE file.
 2) An error within the "unmew11()" function in libclamav/mew.c can be exploited to corrupt heap memory.
 Successful exploitation may allow execution of arbitrary code.
