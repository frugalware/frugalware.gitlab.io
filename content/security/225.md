A vulnerability has been reported in Sun Java Web Start, which can be exploited by malicious people to compromise a user's system.
 The vulnerability is caused due to a boundary error within the Java Web Start component (javaws.exe) when processing JNLP files. This can be exploited to cause a stack-based buffer overflow via a specially crafted JNLP file with an overly long codebase attribute.
 Successful exploitation allows execution of arbitrary code e.g. when a user visits a malicious website.
