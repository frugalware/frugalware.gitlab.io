Slythers Bro has discovered a security issue in the imageop module for Python, which can be exploited by malicious people to cause a DoS (Denial of Service) and potentially compromise a vulnerable system.
 The security issue is caused due to an integer overflow error within the "tovideo()" function and can be exploited to cause a heap-based buffer overflow when specially crafted parameters are passed to the function.
 Successful exploitation may allow execution of arbitrary code.
