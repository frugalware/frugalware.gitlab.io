Some vulnerabilities have been reported in the Linux Kernel, which potentially can be exploited by malicious, local users to cause a DoS (Denial of Service) or disclose potentially sensitive information.
 1) A memory leak exists when releasing PPPoE sockets after they are connected, but before the "PPPIOCGCHAN" ioctl is called. This can be exploited to cause a DoS due to memory exhaustion.
 2) An error within the "\_udp\_lib\_get\_port()" function in net/ipv4/udp.c can be exploited to intercept traffic by binding to a port using a local address if a wildcard bind exists with a local address to that port.
