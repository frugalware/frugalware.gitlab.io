* Vulnerable: 2.6.24-4kalgan1
* Unaffected: 2.6.24-4kalgan2


A vulnerability has been reported in the Linux kernel, which can be exploited by malicious, local users to cause a DoS (Denial of Service).
 The vulnerability is caused due to an error when preventing race conditions between "fcntl\_setlk()" and "close()" calls on SMP systems. This can be exploited to trigger the improper, reordered access to the file descriptor table and the "file\_lock" structure of an inode, between threads running on different CPUs.
