A vulnerability has been reported in the FileField module for Drupal, which can be exploited by malicious users to conduct script insertion attacks.
 Input passed e.g. via the "filepath" parameter is not properly sanitised before being used. This can be exploited to insert arbitrary HTML and script code, which is executed in a user's browser session in context of an affected site when the malicious data is being viewed.
 Successful exploitation requires permission to create or edit content with a FileField and that the administrator has configured a vulnerable display format or uses a special token.
