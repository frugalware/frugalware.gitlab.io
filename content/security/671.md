A security issue has been reported in the FileField module for Drupal, which potentially can be exploited by malicious users to compromise a vulnerable system.
 The security issue exists due to improper creation of a default extension for a new file field when the field configuration page is not saved and can be exploited to upload arbitrary files to a directory inside the webroot.
 Successful exploitation may allow execution of arbitrary PHP code but requires "create" or "edit" permission for the file field.
