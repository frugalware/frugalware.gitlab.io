Hamid Ebadi has reported a vulnerability in t1lib, which can be exploited by malicious users to potentially compromise a vulnerable system.
 The vulnerability is caused due to a boundary error within the "intT1\_EnvGetCompletePath()" function in lib/t1lib/t1env.c. This can be exploited to cause a buffer overflow when an application processes an overly long string in the "FileName" parameter.
