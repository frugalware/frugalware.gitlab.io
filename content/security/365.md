MustLive has discovered a vulnerability in Joomla!, which can be exploited by malicious people to conduct cross-site scripting attacks.
 Input passed to the "searchword" parameter in index.php (when "option" is set to "com\_search") is not properly sanitised before being returned to the user. This can be exploited to execute arbitrary HTML and script code in a user's browser session in context of an affected site.
 Successful exploitation requires that the victim changes the number of search results in a drop-down box, after having clicked on the malicious link.
