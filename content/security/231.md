* Vulnerable: 3.9.5-2
* Unaffected: 3.9.5-3terminus1


mu-b has reported a vulnerability in tcpdump, which potentially can be exploited by malicious people to compromise a user's system.
 The vulnerability is caused due to the incorrect use of the return value of "snprintf()" in print-bgp.c. This can be exploited to cause a buffer overflow by sending specially crafted BGP packets.
 Successful exploitation may allow the execution of arbitrary code.
