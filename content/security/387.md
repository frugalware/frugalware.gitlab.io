A vulnerability has been reported in phpMyAdmin, which can be exploited by malicious people to conduct SQL injection attacks.
 The vulnerability is caused due to the application obtaining parameters via the "$\_REQUEST" variable, and using them without proper sanitation in SQL queries. This can be exploited to manipulate SQL queries by injecting arbitrary SQL code via a malicious cookie.
