Secunia Research has discovered some vulnerabilities in Xpdf, which can be exploited by malicious people to compromise a user's system.
 1) An array indexing error within the "DCTStream::readProgressiveDataUnit()" method in xpdf/Stream.cc can be exploited to corrupt memory via a specially crafted PDF file.
 2) An integer overflow error within the "DCTStream::reset()" method in xpdf/Stream.cc can be exploited to cause a heap-based buffer overflow via a specially crafted PDF file.
 3) A boundary error within the "CCITTFaxStream::lookChar()" method in xpdf/Stream.cc can be exploited to cause a heap-based buffer overflow by tricking a user into opening a PDF file containing a specially crafted "CCITTFaxDecode" filter.
 Successful exploitation allows execution of arbitrary code.
