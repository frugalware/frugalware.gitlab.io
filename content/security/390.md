Some vulnerabilities have been reported in Opera, which can be exploited by malicious people to conduct cross-site scripting attacks, disclose sensitive information, or to bypass certain security restrictions.
 1) A security issue is caused due to a design error when handling input to file form fields, which can potentially be exploited to trick a user into uploading arbitrary files.
 2) An error within the handling of custom comments in image properties can be exploited to execute arbitrary script code in the wrong security context when comments of a malicious image are displayed.
 3) An error in the handling of attribute values when importing XML into a document can be exploited to bypass filters and conduct cross-site scripting attacks if these values are used as document content.
