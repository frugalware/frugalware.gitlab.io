A vulnerability has been reported in MediaWiki, which can be exploited by malicious people to conduct cross-site scripting attacks.
 Input passed to the "useskin" parameter is not properly sanitised before being returned to the user. This can be exploited to execute arbitrary HTML and script code in a user's browser session in context of an affected site.
 Successful exploitation requires that $wgUseSiteCss is enabled, which is the default.
