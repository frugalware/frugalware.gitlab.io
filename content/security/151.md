* Vulnerable: 2.0.3-1
* Unaffected: 2.0.3-2terminus1


A vulnerability has been reported in mod\_perl, which potentially can be exploited by malicious people to cause a DoS (Denial of Service). The vulnerability is caused due to a regular expression in "RegistryCooker.pm" (mod\_perl 2.x) or "PerlRun.pm" (mod\_perl 1.x) that uses the "path\_info" variable without properly escaping it. This can be exploited to cause a DoS by sending requests with specially crafted URLs to a vulnerable server.
