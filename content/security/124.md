Multiple vulnerabilities have been reported in Mozilla Firefox, which can be exploited by malicious people to bypass certain security restrictions, conduct cross-site scripting and spoofing attacks, gain knowledge of sensitive information, and potentially compromise a user's system.
 1) An error in the handling of the "locations.hostname" DOM property can be exploited to bypass certain security restrictions.
 2) It is possible to conduct cross-site scripting attacks against sites containing a frame with a "data:" URI as source. Successful exploitation requires that a user is tricked into visiting a malicious website and opening a blocked popup.
 3) It is possible to open windows containing local files thereby stealing the contents when the full path of a locally saved file containing malicious script code is known. This can be exploited in combination with a flaw in the seeding of the pseudo-random number generator causing downloaded files to be saved to temporary files with a somewhat predictable name. Successful exploitation requires that a user is tricked into visiting a malicious website and opening a blocked popup.
 4) Browser UI elements like the host name and security indicators can be spoofed using a specially crafted custom cursor and manipulating the CSS3 hotspot property.
 5) It may be possible to gain knowledge of sensitive information from a website due to an error resulting in two web pages colliding in the disk cache thereby potentially appending part of one document to the other. Successful exploitation requires that a user is tricked into visiting a malicious website while visiting the target website.
 6) Various errors in the Mozilla parser when handling invalid trailing characters in HTML tag attribute names and during processing of UTF-7 content when child frames inherit the character set of its parent window can be exploited to conduct cross-site scripting attacks.
 7) A vulnerability in the Password Manager may be exploited to conduct phishing attacks.
 8) Multiple memory corruption errors exist in the layout engine, JavaScript engine, and in SVG. Some of these may be exploited to execute arbitrary code on a user's system.
 9) An error within the handling of the onUnload event handler and self-modifying document.write() calls can be exploited to corrupt memory and potentially execute arbitrary code.
