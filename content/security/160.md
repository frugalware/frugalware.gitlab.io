A vulnerability has been reported in the Linux Kernel, which can be exploited by malicious people to cause a DoS (Denial of Service).
 The vulnerability is caused due to an error within the "atalk\_sum\_skb()" function when creating the checksum of an AppleTalk frame that is shorter than specified in the header. This can be exploited to trigger a "BUG\_ON" condition by sending a specially crafted AppleTalk frame to a vulnerable system.
 Successful exploitation requires that the AppleTalk kernel module is loaded.
