A memory leak flaw was found in the way OpenSSL parsed the DTLS Secure Real-time Transport Protocol (SRTP) extension data.
 A flaw was found in the way SSL 3.0 handled padding bytes when decrypting messages encrypted using block ciphers in cipher block chaining (CBC) mode.
 A memory leak flaw was found in the way an OpenSSL handled failed session ticket integrity checks.
 When OpenSSL is configured with "no-ssl3" as a build option, servers could accept and complete a SSL 3.0 handshake, and clients could be configured to send them.
