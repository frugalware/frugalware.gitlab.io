Some vulnerabilities have been reported in FreeType, which can be exploited to cause a DoS (Denial of Service) or potentially compromise an application using the library.
 1) An error exists in the "ft\_var\_readpackedpoints()" function in src/truetype/ttgxvar.c when processing TrueType GX fonts and can be exploited to cause a heap-based buffer overflow via a specially crafted font.
 2) An error within the "Ins\_SHZ()" function in src/truetype/ttinterp.c when handling the "SHZ" bytecode instruction can be exploited to cause a crash and potentially execute arbitrary code via a specially crafted font.
