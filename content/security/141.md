Luigi Auriemma has reported some vulnerabilities in Network Audio System, which potentially can be exploited by malicious, local users to gain escalated privileges or by malicious people to cause a DoS (Denial of Service).
 1) A boundary error within "accept\_att\_local()" in server/os/connection.c can be exploited to cause a stack-based buffer overflow via an overly long (greater than 64 bytes) slave name in a USL connection. Successful exploitation may allow malicious, local users to gain root privileges.
 2) An input validation error within "AddResource()" in server/dia/resource.c can be exploited to cause the service to crash via a specially crafted packet with an invalid client ID.
 3) An integer-overflow error within "ProcAuWriteElement()" in server/dia/audispatch.c can be exploited to cause the service to crash via a specially crafted packet with an overly large max\_samples value.
 4) A boundary error within "ProcAuSetElements()" in server/dia/audispatch.c can be exploited to cause the service to crash via a specially crafted packet with an overly large num\_actions or numElements value.
 5) An input validation error within "compileInputs()" in server/dia/auutil.c can be exploited to cause the service to crash via a specially crafted packet with an invalid element number.
 6) A NULL-pointer dereference error when processing simultaneous connections can be exploited to cause the service to crash.
