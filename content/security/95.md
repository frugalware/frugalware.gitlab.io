Liu Qishuai has reported a vulnerability in libgtop2, which can be exploited by malicious, local users to gain escalated privileges.
 The vulnerability is caused due to a boundary error within the "glibtop\_get\_proc\_map\_s()" function in sysdeps/linux/procmap.c. This can be exploited to cause a stack-based buffer overflow by running a process with a specially crafted long path and tricking a victim into running an application using the library (e.g. gnome-system-monitor).
