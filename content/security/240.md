Some vulnerabilities have been reported in Joomla!, which can be exploited by malicious people to conduct session fixation attacks, cross-site scripting attacks or HTTP response splitting attacks.
 1) Certain unspecified input passed in com\_search, com\_content and mod\_login is not properly sanitised before being returned to a user. This can be exploited to execute arbitrary HTML and script code in a user's browser session in context of an affected site.
 2) Input passed to the "url" parameter is not properly sanitised before being returned to the user. This can be exploited to insert arbitrary HTTP headers, which will be included in a response sent to the user, allowing for execution of arbitrary HTML and script code in a user's browser session in context of an affected site.
 3) An error exists in the handling of sessions and can be exploited to hijack another user's session by tricking the user into logging in after following a specially crafted link.
