Some vulnerabilities have been reported in udev, which can be exploited by malicious, local users to cause a DoS (Denial of Service) or gain escalated privileges.
 1) A vulnerability is caused due to udev not properly verifying the credentials of received NETLINK messages. This can be exploited to gain escalated privileges by sending multicast NETLINK messages.
 2) A vulnerability is caused due to a boundary error within the "util\_path\_encode()" function in udev/lib/libudev-util.c. This can be exploited to cause a crash by providing specially crafted input.
