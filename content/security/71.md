* Unaffected: 1.1.3-1siwenna1


Some vulnerabilities have been reported in xine-lib, which potentially can be exploited by malicious people to compromise a user's system.
 1) A vulnerability is caused due to a boundary error within the "real\_parse\_sdp()" function in src/input/libreal/real.c. This can be exploited to cause a buffer overflow by e.g. tricking a user into connecting to a malicious server.
 2) A buffer overflow exists in the libmms library: Anon Sricharoenchai has discovered some vulnerabilities in MiMMS, which can be exploited by malicious people to cause a DoS (Denial of Service) and potentially to compromise a user's system.
 The vulnerabilities are caused due to boundary errors within the "get\_header()" and "get\_media\_packet" functions when read data from the server. This can be exploited to cause stack-based buffer overflows and may allow arbitrary code execution.
