* Vulnerable: 2.3.1-2
* Unaffected: 2.4.3-1kalgan1


Some vulnerabilities have been reported in Pidgin, which potentially can be exploited by malicious people to compromise a user's system.
 The vulnerabilities are caused due to integer overflow errors in the "msn\_slplink\_process\_msg" function in libpurple/protocols/msnp9/slplink.c and libpurple/protocols/msn/slplink.c, and can potentially be exploited to execute arbitrary code via a specially crafted SLP message.
 Successful exploitation requires that the attacker is allowed to send messages to a victim (by default only users in the buddy list).
