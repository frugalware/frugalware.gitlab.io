Rapid7 has reported a vulnerability in NVIDIA Binary Graphics Driver for Linux, which can be exploited by malicious, local users to gain escalated privileges and potentially by malicious people to compromise a user's system.
 A boundary error when performing accelerated rendering of glyphs can be exploited to cause a buffer overflow via a specially crafted short sequence of user-supplied glyphs.
 Successful exploitation allows execution of arbitrary code with "root" privileges.
