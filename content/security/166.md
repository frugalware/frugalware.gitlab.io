Ivan Fratric has reported a vulnerability in PHP, which potentially can be exploited by malicious people to cause a DoS (Denial of Service). The vulnerability is caused due to an integer overflow within the "readwbmp()" function in ext/gd/libgd/wbmp.c. This can be exploited to e.g. cause a DoS by tricking a PHP script into loading a specially crafted wbmp image.
 Stefan Esser has reported some vulnerabilities in PHP, which can be exploited by malicious users to compromise a vulnerable system.
 1) A double free error within the "session\_regenerate\_id()" function can be exploited to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the PHP interpreter.
 2) An error in the "array\_user\_key\_compare()" function where key references are incorrectly destroyed can be exploited to cause memory corruption.
 3) An error exists within the "unserialize()" function when unserialising specially escaped S: data types. This can be exploited to e.g. disclose certain parts of the heap memory.
 A vulnerability is caused due to the use of an incorrect regular expression within the "FILTER\_VALIDATE\_EMAIL" filter of the ext/filter extension. This can be exploited to inject newlines via specially crafted email addresses, which may allow mail header injection.
