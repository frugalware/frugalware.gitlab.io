Janek Vind has discovered a vulnerability in WordPress, which can be exploited by malicious people to conduct cross-site scripting attacks.
 Input passed to the "posts\_columns" parameter in wp-admin/edit-post-rows.php is not properly sanitised before being returned to the user. This can be exploited to execute arbitrary HTML and script code in a user's browser session in context of an affected site. Successful exploitation requires that "register\_globals" is enabled.
