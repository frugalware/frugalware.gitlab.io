* Vulnerable: 1.1.22-2kalgan1
* Unaffected: 1.1.22-2kalgan1


A vulnerability has been reported in libxslt, which can be exploited by malicious people to cause a DoS (Denial of Service) and potentially to compromise a vulnerable system.
 The vulnerability is caused due to an error in the handling of XSL style-sheet files. This can potentially be exploited to trigger the use of uninitialized memory in e.g. a call to "free()" when a specially crafted XSL file is being processed by an application using the library.
 Successful exploitation may allow execution of arbitrary code.
