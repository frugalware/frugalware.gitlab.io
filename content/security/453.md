* Vulnerable: 2.2.0-1
* Unaffected: 2.2.5-1kalgan1


Some vulnerabilities have been reported in GnuTLS, which can be exploited by malicious people to cause a DoS (Denial of Service) or to potentially compromise an application using the library.
 1) A boundary error exists in the processing "Client Hello" messages containing a "Server Name" extension. This can be exploited to cause a heap-based buffer overflow via a specially crafted TLS packet.
 Successful exploitation may allow execution of arbitrary code.
 2) A NULL-pointer dereference error in the processing of TLS packets containing multiple "Client Hello" messages can be exploited to crash an affected application.
 3) A signedness error exists within the "\_gnutls\_ciphertext2compressed()" function in lib/gnutls\_cipher.c. This can be exploited to cause an out of bounds read and crash an affected application via specially crafted, encrypted TLS data.
