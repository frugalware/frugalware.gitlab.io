Jann Horn discovered that OpenSSH incorrectly handled wildcards in AcceptEnv lines. A remote attacker could use this issue to trick OpenSSH into accepting any environment variable that contains the characters before the wildcard character.
 Matthew Vernon reported that if a SSH server offers a HostCertificate that the ssh client doesn't accept, then the client doesn't check the DNS for SSHFP records. As a consequence a malicious server can disable SSHFP-checking by presenting a certificate.
