Xavier Roche has reported a vulnerability in PHP, which can be exploited by malicious people to cause a DoS (Denial of Service).
 The vulnerability is caused due to the incorrect use of libpng within the function "gdPngReadData()" in ext/gd/libgd/gd\_png.c of the GD extension when processing truncated data. This can be exploited to cause an infinite loop by e.g. tricking an application to process a specially crafted file.
