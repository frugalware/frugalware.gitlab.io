Some vulnerabilities have been reported in phpMyAdmin, which can be exploited by malicious users to disclose sensitive information and by malicious users and malicious people to compromise a vulnerable system.
 1) An error within the "Swekey\_login()" function in libraries/auth/swekey/swekey.auth.lib.php can be exploited to overwrite session variables and e.g. inject and execute arbitrary PHP code.
 2) Input passed to the "PMA\_createTargetTables()" function in libraries/server\_synchronize.lib.php is not properly sanitised before calling the "preg\_replace()" function with the "e" modifier. This can be exploited to execute arbitrary PHP code via URL-encoded NULL bytes.
 3) Input passed to the "PMA\_displayTableBody()" function in libraries/display\_tbl.lib.php is not properly sanitised before being used to include files. This can be exploited to include arbitrary files from local resources via directory traversal sequences.
 NOTE: A weakness in setup scripts, which could lead to arbitrary PHP code injection if session variables are overwritten has also been reported.
