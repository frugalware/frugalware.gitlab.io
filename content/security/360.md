Chris Rohlf has reported a vulnerability in Ruby-GNOME2, which can potentially be exploited by malicious people to compromise an application using the library.
 The vulnerability is caused due to a format string error within the "Gtk::MessageDialog.new()" method in gtk/src/rbgtkmessagedialog.c and can potentially be exploited to execute arbitrary code when a specially crafted string is passed to the affected function.
 NOTE: Exploitation and impact of this vulnerability depend on how an application uses the affected function of the vulnerable library.
