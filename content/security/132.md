Moritz Jodeit has reported a vulnerability in tcpdump, which potentially can be exploited by malicious people to cause a DoS (Denial of Service).
 The vulnerability is caused due to an off-by-one error within the "parse\_elements()" function in print-802.11.c. This can be exploited to cause a one byte buffer overflow via a specially crafted 802.11 frame.
