Some vulnerabilities have been reported in Mozilla Firefox, which can be exploited by malicious people to conduct spoofing attacks, bypass certain security restrictions, disclose sensitive information, or compromise a user's system.
 1) Multiple errors in the layout and JavaScript engines can be exploited to corrupt memory and potentially execute arbitrary code.
 2) An error in the garbage collection process when handling a set of cloned XUL DOM elements linked as a parent and child can be exploited to access freed memory and execute arbitrary code.
 3) An error can be exploited via the "nsIRDFService" interface and a cross-domain redirect to bypass the same-origin policy and read XML data from another domain.
 4) An error in libpng when handling out-of-memory conditions can be exploited to potentially execute arbitrary code.
 5) An error when handling invisible control characters included in the location bar can be exploited to spoof a trusted URL.
