Clemens Kolbitsch and Sylvester Keil have reported a vulnerability in MadWifi, which can be exploited by malicious people to cause a DoS (Denial of Service).
 The vulnerability is caused due to an error in the processing of beacon frames. This can be exploited via a specially crafted beacon frame with an overly large "length" value (greater than 15) in the extended supported rates element ("xrates").
 Successful exploitation causes the driver to exit and results in a kernel panic.
