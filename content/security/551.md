Hadi Kiamarsi has discovered a vulnerability in phpMyAdmin, which can be exploited by malicious people to conduct cross-site scripting attacks.
 Input passed to the "db" parameter in pmd\_pdf.php is not properly sanitised before being returned to the user. This can be exploited to execute arbitrary HTML and script code in a user's browser session in context of an affected site.
 Successful exploitation may require that the victim has valid user credentials.
