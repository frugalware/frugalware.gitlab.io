A vulnerability has been discovered in GNOME Display Manager, which can be exploited by malicious, local users to cause a DoS (Denial of Service).
 The vulnerability is caused due to the GDM daemon improperly handling NULL values returned by the "g\_strsplit" function. This can be exploited to crash the GNOME Display Manager by sending specially crafted requests to the local GDM socket.
