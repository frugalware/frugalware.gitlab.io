Two vulnerabilities have been reported in libexif, which can be exploited by malicious people to cause a DoS (Denial of Service) or to compromise an application using the library.
 1) An integer overflow error in the "exif\_data\_load\_data\_thumbnail()" function in exif-data.c when processing exif image tags can be exploited to cause a memory corruption and may allow execution of arbitrary code via a specially crafted exif file.
 2) An infinite recursion error in the "exif\_loader\_write()" function in exif-loader.c when handling exif image tags can be exploited to cause an application to crash via a specially crafted exif file.
