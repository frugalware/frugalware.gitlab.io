Some vulnerabilities have been reported in Drupal, which can be exploited by malicious people to conduct script insertion attacks or to disclose potentially sensitive information.
 1) User provided input is not properly sanitised before being used. This can be exploited to insert arbitrary HTML and script code, which will be executed in a user's browser session in context of an affected site when the malicious data is viewed and interpreted as UTF-7.
 Successful exploitation requires the ability to post content.
 2) An unspecified error can be exploited to disclose information about form submissions when a user is tricked into submitting a form after following a specially crafted link to the site. This can further be exploited to conduct e.g. cross-site request forgery attacks.
