Some vulnerabilities and weaknesses have been reported in Mozilla Firefox, which can be exploited by malicious people to bypass certain security restrictions, disclose potentially sensitive information, conduct cross-site scripting and phishing attacks, and potentially compromise a user's system.
 1) An unspecified error in the handling of "XPCNativeWrappers" can lead to the execution of arbitrary Javascript code with the user's privileges via "setTimeout()" calls.
 2) Various errors in the handling of Javascript code can be exploited to conduct cross-site scripting attacks or execute arbitrary code.
 3) Various errors in the layout engine can be exploited to cause a memory corruption.
 4) Various errors in the Javascript engine can be exploited to cause a memory corruption.
 Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities may allow execution of arbitrary code.
 5) An error within the handling of HTTP "Referer:" headers sent with requests to URLs containing "Basic Authentication" credentials having an empty username can be exploited to bypass cross-site request forgery protections.
 6) The problem is that Firefox offers a previously configured private SSL certificate when establishing connections to webservers requesting SSL Client Authentication. This can potentially be exploited to disclose sensitive information via a malicious webserver.
 7) An error in the handling of the "jar:" protocol can be exploited to establish connections to arbitrary ports on the local machine.
 8) An error when displaying XUL pop-up windows can be exploited to hide the window's borders and facilitate phishing attacks.
