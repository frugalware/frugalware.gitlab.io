Multiple vulnerabilities have been reported in Wireshark, which can be exploited by malicious people to cause a DoS (Denial of Service) and potentially compromise a vulnerable system.
 1) A boundary error in the "dissect\_enttec\_dmx\_data()" function (epan/dissectors/packet-enttec.c) when processing RLE Compressed DMX data of the ENTTEC protocol can be exploited to cause a buffer overflow via a specially crafted packet sent to UDP port 3333.
 2) A boundary error in the MAC-LTE dissector (epan/dissectors/packet-mac-lte.c) can be exploited to cause a stack-based buffer overflow.
 3) A boundary error in the "snmp\_usm\_password\_to\_key\_sha1()" function (asn1/snmp/packet-snmp-template.c) can be exploited to cause a stack-based buffer overflow.
 Successful exploitation of vulnerabilities #1, #2, and #3 may allow execution of arbitrary code.
 4) An error in the ASN.1 BER dissector can be exploited to corrupt memory and cause the process to terminate.
