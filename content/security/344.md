A vulnerability has been reported in Cairo, which potentially can be exploited by malicious people to compromise an application using the library.
 The vulnerability is caused due to an integer overflow error within the "read\_png()" function in cairo-png.c. This can be exploited to cause a heap-based buffer overflow via a specially crafted PNG file.
 Successful exploitation may allow execution of arbitrary code.
