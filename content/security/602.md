1) The exit\_notify function in kernel/exit.c does not restrict exit signals when the CAP\_KILL capability is held, which allows local users to send an arbitrary signal to a process by running a program that modifies the exit\_signal field and then uses an exec system call to launch a setuid application.
 2) drivers/char/agp/generic.c in the agp subsystem does not zero out pages that may later be available to a user-space process, which allows local users to obtain sensitive information by reading these pages.
 3) Integer overflow in rose\_sendmsg (sys/net/af\_rose.c) might allow remote attackers to obtain sensitive information via a large length value, which causes "garbage" memory to be sent (DoS from local network).
 4) The ecryptfs\_write\_metadata\_to\_contents function in the eCryptfs functionality uses an incorrect size when writing kernel memory to an eCryptfs file header, which triggers an out-of-bounds read and allows local users to obtain portions of kernel memory.
 5) The sock\_getsockopt function in net/core/sock.c does not initialize a certain structure member, which allows local users to obtain potentially sensitive information from kernel memory via an SO\_BSDCOMPAT getsockopt request (local privilege escalation).
