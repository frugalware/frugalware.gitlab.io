Philip Van Hoof has reported a vulnerability in Evolution, which potentially can be exploited by malicious people to compromise a user's system.
 The vulnerability is caused due to the "imap\_rescan()" function in camel/providers/imap/camel-imap-folder.c not properly sanitising the "SEQUENCE" value before being used to index arrays. This may be exploited to execute arbitrary code by e.g. tricking a user into using a malicious IMAP server.
