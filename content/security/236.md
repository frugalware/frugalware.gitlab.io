Secunia Research has discovered a vulnerability in Vim, which can be exploited by malicious people to compromise a vulnerable system.
 A format string error in the "helptags\_one()" function in src/ex\_cmds.c when running the "helptags" command can be exploited to execute arbitrary code via specially crafted help files.
 Successful exploitation requires that the user is tricked into running "helptags" on malicious data.
