A vulnerability has been reported in the Linux Kernel, which can be exploited by malicious, local users to cause a DoS (Denial of Service) and potentially gain escalated privileges.
 The vulnerability is caused due to the incorrect initialisation of the proto\_ops structure for certain protocols (e.g. PF\_APPLETALK, PF\_IPX, PF\_IRDA, PF\_X25, PF\_AX25 families, PF\_BLUETOOTH, PF\_IUCV, PF\_INET6 (with IPPROTO\_SCTP), PF\_PPPOX, and PF\_ISDN), which can be exploited to cause a NULL pointer dereference when triggering the "sock\_sendpage()" function for an incorrectly initialised socket.
