A security issue has been reported in ProFTPD, which potentially can be exploited by malicious people to bypass certain security restrictions.
 The security issue is caused due to an error within ProFTPD's Auth API. If multiple authentication modules are used, it is possible that one module provides data, which is then authenticated against another module. This can e.g. be exploited to bypass certain security restrictions if authentication modules are configured with different policies.
