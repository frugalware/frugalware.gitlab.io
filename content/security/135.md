Some vulnerabilities have been reported in MPlayer, which can potentially be exploited by malicious people to compromise a user's system.
 The vulnerabilities are caused due to boundary errors in the "DMO\_VideoDecoder\_Open()" function in loader/dmo/DMO\_VideoDecoder.c and in the "DS\_VideoDecoder\_Open()" function in loader/dshow/DS\_VideoDecoder.c. These can be exploited to cause heap-based buffer overflows and may allow execution of arbitrary code via a specially crafted media file.
