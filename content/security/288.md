Robert Buchholz has reported a vulnerability in libsndfile, which potentially can be exploited by malicious people to compromise an application using the library.
 The vulnerability is caused due to a boundary error within the "flac\_buffer\_copy()" function in src/flac.c when handling FLAC files with variable bitrates. This can be exploited to cause a heap-based buffer overflow by e.g. tricking a user into playing a specially crafted FLAC file with an application using the library.
 Successful exploitation may allow the execution of arbitrary code.
