A vulnerability has been reported in the gdmchooser application of the GNOME Display Manager, which can be exploited by malicious, local users to gain escalated privileges.
 The vulnerability is caused due to a format string error within the "gdm\_chooser\_add\_host()" function in gdm2/gui/gdmchooser.c. This can be exploited to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the gdmchooser application by entering a specially crafted string when providing a remote host.
