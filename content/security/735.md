Some vulnerabilities have been reported in Xpdf, which can be exploited by malicious people to potentially compromise a user's system.
1) Multiple integer overflows in "SplashBitmap::SplashBitmap()" can be exploited to cause heap-based buffer overflows.
2) An integer overflow error in "ObjectStream::ObjectStream()" can be exploited to cause a heap-based buffer overflow.
3) Multiple integer overflows in "Splash::drawImage()" can be exploited to cause heap-based buffer overflows.
4) An integer overflow error in "PSOutputDev::doImageL1Sep()" can be exploited to cause a heap-based buffer overflow when converting a PDF document to a PS file.
Successful exploitation of the vulnerabilities may allow execution of arbitrary code by tricking a user into opening a specially crafted PDF file.
