Some vulnerabilities, security issues, and a weakness have been reported in Mozilla Firefox, which can be exploited by malicious people to disclose potentially sensitive information, bypass certain security restrictions, conduct cross-site scripting and cross-site request forgery attacks, and potentially compromise a user's system.
 1) Multiple errors in the browser engine can be exploited to corrupt memory and potentially execute arbitrary code.
 2) Multiple errors in the JavaScript engine can be exploited to corrupt memory and potentially execute arbitrary code.
 3) An error exists when the "jar:" scheme is used to wrap a URI, which serves content with "Content-Disposition: attachment". This can be exploited to e.g. conduct cross-site scripting attacks on sites that allow users to upload arbitrary content, which is served as "application/java-archive" or "application/x-jar", and that rely on the HTTP header "Content-Disposition: attachment" to prevent potentially untrusted content.
 4) An error when loading a Adobe Flash file via the "view-source:" scheme can be exploited to conduct cross-site request forgery attacks or read and write Local Shared Objects on a user's system e.g. for tracking purposes.
 5) An error in the processing of XBL bindings can be exploited to conduct script insertion attacks on sites that allow user to embed third-party stylesheets.
 6) Errors in "XMLHttpRequest" and "XPCNativeWrapper.toString" can be exploited to bypass the same-origin policy and potentially execute code with chrome privileges.
 7) A weakness in the handling of "SearchForm" URIs can be exploited to execute arbitrary script code in the context of an arbitrary site when a user performs an empty search in a specially crafted plugin.
 8) An error in the handling of POST data may result in unintended information disclosure. When an inner frame of a web page is saved as file POST data of the outer page is sent to the URL of the inner frame.
 9) An error in the processing of the "Refresh" header can potentially be exploited to conduct cross-site scripting attacks.
 10) A vulnerability is caused due to an error when calling the "nsTextFrame::ClearTextRun()" function and can be exploited to corrupt memory.
