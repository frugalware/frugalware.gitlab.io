Multiple vulnerabilities have been reported in LibreOffice, which can be exploited by malicious people to compromise a user's system.
 The vulnerabilities are caused due to errors in the import filter when processing Lotus Word Pro (LWP) files and can be exploited to cause a stack-based buffer overflow via a specially crafted file.
 Successful exploitation may allow execution of arbitrary code, but requires tricking a user into opening a malicious LWP file.
