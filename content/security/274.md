Some vulnerabilities have been reported in ClamAV, which can potentially be exploited by malicious people to cause a DoS (Denial of Service) or to compromise a vulnerable system.
 1) A NULL-pointer dereference error exists within the "cli\_scanrtf()" function in libclamav/rtf.c. This can potentially be exploited to crash ClamAV via a specially crafted RTF file.
 2) A NULL-pointer dereference error exists within the "cli\_html\_normalise()" function in libclamav/htmlnorm.c. This can potentially be exploited to crash ClamAV via a specially crafted HTML file containing a "data" URL scheme.
 3) The recipient address extracted from email messages is not properly sanitised before being used in a call to "popen()" when executing sendmail. This can be exploited to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the clamav-milter process by sending an email with a specially crafted recipient address to the affected system.
 Successful exploitation requires that clamav-milter is started with the "black hole" mode activated.
