Mozilla has acknowledged a security issue in Firefox, which potentially can be exploited by malicious people to compromise a user's system.
 The security issue is caused due to the "-chrome" parameter allowing execution of arbitrary Javascript script code in chrome context. This can be exploited to execute arbitrary commands on a user's system e.g. via applications invoking Firefox with unfiltered command line arguments.
