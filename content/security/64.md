Teemu Salmela has reported a security issue in GNU tar, which can be exploited by malicious people to overwrite arbitrary files.
 The security issue is caused due to the "extract\_archive()" function in extract.c and the "extract\_mangle()" function in mangle.c still processing the deprecated "GNUTYPE\_NAMES" record type containing symbolic links. This can be exploited to overwrite arbitrary files by e.g. tricking a user into unpacking a specially crafted tar file.
