A vulnerability has been reported in NTP, which can be exploited by malicious people to cause a DoS (Denial of Service) or compromise a vulnerable system.
 The vulnerability is caused due to a boundary error within the "crypto\_recv()" function in ntpd/ntp\_crypto.c. This can be exploited to cause a stack-based buffer overflow via a specially crafted packet sent to the "ntpd".
 Successful exploitation allows execution of arbitrary code, but requires that Autokey Authentication is configured via "crypto pw [password]" in ntp.conf.
