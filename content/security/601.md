A vulnerability has been reported in file, which can be exploited by malicious people to potentially compromise a user's system.
 The vulnerability is caused due to a boundary error within the "cdf\_read\_sat()" function in src/cdf.c. This can be exploited to cause a heap-based buffer overflow via a specially crafted compound document file.
 Successful exploitation may allow execution of arbitrary code.
