Evan Teran has reported a security issue in the Linux kernel, which potentially can be exploited by malicious, local users to cause a DoS (Denial of Service).
 The vulnerability is caused due to an error in ptrace when single-stepping a debugged child process with invalid values in the "CS" register, which can be exploited to cause a kernel oops.
