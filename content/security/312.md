Secunia Research has discovered a vulnerability in CUPS, which can be exploited by malicious people to compromise a vulnerable system.
 The vulnerability is caused due to a boundary error within the "ippReadIO()" function in cups/ipp.c when processing IPP (Internet Printing Protocol) tags. This can be exploited to overwrite one byte on the stack with a zero by sending an IPP request containing specially crafted "textWithLanguage" or "nameWithLanguage" tags. Successful exploitation allows execution of arbitrary code.
