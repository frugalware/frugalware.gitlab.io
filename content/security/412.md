Some vulnerabilities have been reported in CUPS, which can be exploited by malicious people to cause a DoS (Denial of Service) or to potentially compromise a vulnerable system.
 1) A boundary error exists within the "cgiCompileSearch()" function in cgi-bin/search.c. This can be exploited to cause a heap-based buffer overflow via a specially crafted IPP request.
 Successful exploitation may allow execution of arbitrary code, but requires that the vulnerable system is sharing printers on the network.
 NOTE: If printer sharing is disabled, the vulnerability can only be exploited by malicious, local users.
 2) A boundary error exists within the "gif\_read\_image()" function in filter/image-gif.c. This can be exploited to cause a buffer overflow via overly large "code\_size" values in GIF image files.
 Successful exploitation may allow execution of arbitrary code.
