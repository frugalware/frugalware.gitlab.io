Guido Landi has discovered a vulnerability in xine-lib, which can be exploited by malicious people to compromise a user's system.
 The vulnerability is caused due to a boundary error within the "demux\_nsf\_send\_chunk()" function in src/demuxers/demux\_nsf.c. This can be exploited to cause a stack-based buffer overflow via an overly long NSF title.
