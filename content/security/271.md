A vulnerability has been reported in RealPlayer and Helix Player, which can be exploited by malicious people to compromise a user's system.
 The vulnerability is caused due to a boundary error in the wallclock functionality in "SmilTimeValue::parseWallClockValue()" when handling time formats. This can be exploited to cause a stack-based buffer overflow via an SMIL file with an overly long, specially-crafted time string.
 Successful exploitation allows execution of arbitrary code when a user e.g. visits a malicious website.
