A weakness has been discovered in Konqueror, which can potentially be exploited by malicious people to conduct cross-site scripting attacks.
 The weakness is caused due to an error in the parsing of comments within title tags of an HTML document. Arbitrary HTML and script code in a comment tag is executed in a user's browser session when preceded by the corresponding closing title tag.
 Successful exploitation is possible on web sites that allow users to insert unsanitised HTML and script code within a comment into such a tag.
