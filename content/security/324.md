Some vulnerabilities and weaknesses have been reported in PHP, where some have unknown impacts and others can be exploited to bypass certain security restrictions.
 1) Various errors exist in the "htmlentities" and "htmlspecialchars" functions where partial multibyte sequences are not accepted.
 2) Various boundary errors exist in the "fnmatch()", "setlocale()", and "glob()" functions and can be exploited to cause buffer overflows.
 3) An error in the processing of the "mail.force\_extra\_parameters" directive within an ".htaccess" file can be exploited to bypass the "safe\_mode" directive.
