Secunia Research has discovered a vulnerability in Samba, which can be exploited by malicious people to compromise a vulnerable system.
 The vulnerability is caused due to a boundary error within the "send\_mailslot()" function. This can be exploited to cause a stack-based buffer overflow with zero bytes via a specially crafted "SAMLOGON" domain logon packet containing a username string placed at an odd offset followed by an overly long GETDC string.
 Successful exploitation allows execution of arbitrary code, but requires that the "domain logons" option is enabled.
