Two vulnerabilities have been reported in Clam AntiVirus. One has an unknown impact, while the other can be exploited by malicious people to cause a DoS (Denial of Service) or to compromise a vulnerable system.
 1) An unspecified file descriptor leak error exists within libclamav/chmunpack.c.
 2) A signedness error exists within the "cab\_unstore()" function in libclamav/cab.c. This can be exploited to cause a stack based buffer overflow via a specially crafted ".cab" file, and may allow execution of arbitrary code or crashing of the clamd process.
