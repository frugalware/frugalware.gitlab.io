* Vulnerable: 2.3.5-2
* Unaffected: 2.3.7-1kalgan1


Some vulnerabilities have been reported in FreeType, which potentially can be exploited by malicious people to compromise an application using the library.
 1) An integer overflow error exists in the processing of PFB font files. This can be exploited to cause a heap-based buffer overflow via a PFB file containing a specially crafted "Private" dictionary table.
 2) An error in the processing of PFB font files can be exploited to trigger the "free()" of memory areas that are not allocated on the heap.
 3) An off-by-one error exists in the processing of PFB font files. This can be exploited to cause a one-byte heap-based buffer overflow via a specially crafted PFB file.
 4) An off-by-one error exists in the implementation of the "SHC" instruction while processing TTF files. This can be exploited to cause a one-byte heap-based buffer overflow via a specially crafted TTF file.
 Successful exploitation of the vulnerabilities may allow execution of arbitrary code.
