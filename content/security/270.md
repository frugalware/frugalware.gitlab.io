A vulnerability has been reported in Asterisk, which can be exploited by malicious people to cause a DoS (Denial of Service).
 The vulnerability is caused due to an error when handling emails with a malformed MIME body. This can be exploited to crash the service by sending a specially crafted email to a user and tricking him into listening to the voicemail.
 Successful exploitation requires that the IMAP backend for the voicemail feature is used. Reportedly, other backends are not affected.
