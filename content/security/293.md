* Vulnerable: 1.0.4-1
* Unaffected: 1.0.4-2terminus1


Some vulnerabilities have been reported in the X.Org X11 X Font Server (XFS), which can be exploited by malicious, local users to gain escalated privileges.
 1) An integer overflow exists within the handlers for the X protocol requests "QueryXBitmaps" and "QueryXExtents", which do not correctly check the "length" parameters before passing them to the "build\_range()" function. This can be exploited to cause a heap-based buffer overflow by sending specially crafted "QueryXBitmaps" and "QueryXExtents" requests to a vulnerable service.
 2) An error exists within the handler for the X protocol requests "QueryXBitmaps" and "QueryXExtents" when calling the "swap\_char2b()" function, which can be exploited to swap an arbitrary number of bytes on the heap, resulting in a heap corruption.
