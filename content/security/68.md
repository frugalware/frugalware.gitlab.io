Some vulnerabilities have been reported in LHa, which can be exploited by malicious people to cause a DoS (Denial of Service) and potentially compromise a vulnerable system.
 1) An infinite loop within the "read\_pt\_len()", "read\_c\_len()", "decode\_c\_st1()", and "decode\_p\_st1()" function in huf.c can be exploited to cause a DoS due to CPU consumption by e.g. tricking a user or automated system into unpacking a specially crafted archive.
 2) A buffer overflow and a boundary error within the "make\_table()" function in maketbl.c can be exploited to modify certain stack data and cause a buffer overflow by e.g. tricking a user or automated system into unpacking a specially crafted archive.
