* Vulnerable: 0.8.6-11
* Unaffected: 0.8.6-12kalgan1


Some vulnerabilities have been reported in VLC Media Player, which potentially can be exploited by malicious people to compromise a user's system.
 1) An integer overflow error within the "MP4\_ReadBox\_rdrf()" function in modules/demux/mp4/libmp4.c can be exploited to cause a heap-based buffer overflow via e.g. a MP4 file with a specially crafted RDRF atom.
 2) A boundary error within the "sdpplin\_parse()" function in modules/access/rtsp/real\_sdpplin.c can be exploited to overwrite arbitrary memory regions.
 3) Two integer overflow errors within the "cinepak\_decode\_frame()" function in modules/codec/cinepak.c can be exploited to cause a heap-based buffer overflow.
 Successful exploitation of the vulnerabilities may allow execution of arbitrary code.
