Two vulnerabilities have been reported in GNUStep Base, which can be exploited by malicious, local users to potentially gain escalated privileges or disclose sensitive information.
 1) The "gdomap" application includes the content of files in error messages when parsing a configuration file specified via the "-c" command line option. This can be exploited to disclose sensitive information by passing an arbitrary file as configuration file to the application.
 2) An integer overflow error exists in the "gdomap" application when parsing configuration files. This can be exploited to cause a heap-based buffer overflow when a specially crafted configuration file containing a large number lines is being processed.
 Successful exploitation of the vulnerabilities requires that the "gdomap" binary has the "setuid" bit set and is owned by e.g. root.
