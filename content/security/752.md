Aditya Modha and Samir Shah discovered a vulnerability in WordPress, which can be exploited by malicious people to conduct cross-site scripting attacks.
 Input passed via the URL to e.g. wp-comments-post.php is not properly sanitised within the "wp\_guess\_url()" function in wp-includes/functions.php before being returned to the user. This can be exploited to execute arbitrary HTML and script code in a user's browser session in context of an affected site.
