A vulnerability has been reported in CUPS, which can be exploited by malicious people to cause a DoS (Denial of Service) or potentially compromise a vulnerable system.
 The vulnerability is caused due to a signedness error within the "asn1\_get\_string()" function in backend/snmp.c. This can be exploited to cause a stack-based buffer overflow via specially crafted SNMP responses containing ASN1 encoded strings with negative length values.
 Successful exploitation on 1.3.x versions requires that the snmp backend is configured in snmp.conf.
