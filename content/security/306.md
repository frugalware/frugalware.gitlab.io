Some vulnerabilities and a weakness have been reported in Mozilla SeaMonkey, which can be exploited by malicious people to disclose sensitive information, conduct phishing attacks, manipulate certain data, and potentially compromise a user's system.
 1) Various errors in the browser engine can be exploited to cause a memory corruption.
 2) Various errors in the Javascript engine can be exploited to cause a memory corruption. Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities may allow execution of arbitrary code.
 3) An error in the handling of onUnload events can be exploited to read and manipulate the document's location of new pages.
 4) Input passed to the user ID when making an HTTP request using Digest Authentication is not properly sanitised before being used in a request. This can be exploited to insert arbitrary HTTP headers into a user's request when a proxy is used.
 5) An error when displaying web pages written in the XUL markup language can be exploited to hide the window's title bar and facilitate phishing attacks.
 6) An error exists in the handling of "smb:" and "sftp:" URI schemes on Linux systems with gnome-vfs support. This can be exploited to read any file owned by the target user via a specially crafted page on the same server. Successful exploitation requires that the attacker has write access to a mutually accessible location on the target server and the user is tricked into loading the malicious page.
 7) An unspecified error in the handling of "XPCNativeWrappers" can lead to execution of arbitrary Javascript code with the user's privileges via subsequent access by the browser chrome (e.g. when a user right-clicks to open a context menu).
