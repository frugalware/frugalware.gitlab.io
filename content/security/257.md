A security issue has been reported in po4a, which can be exploited by malicious, local users to perform certain actions with escalated privileges.
 The security issue is caused due to the "gettextize()" function in lib/Locale/Po4a/Po.pm creating the file "/tmp/gettextization.failed.po" in an insecure manner. This can be exploited via symlink attacks to e.g. overwrite arbitrary files with the permissions of the user running the po4a-gettextize tool.
