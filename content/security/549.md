Two vulnerabilities have been reported in Drupal, which can be exploited by malicious users to conduct script insertion attacks.
 An input passed as book page titles is not properly sanitised before being stored. This can be exploited to insert arbitrary HTML and script code, which is executed in a user's browser session in context of an affected site when the malicious data is viewed.
 For more info about the other issue, see FSA548.
 Successful exploitation requires valid user credentials with the "create book content" permission or the permission to edit book nodes.
