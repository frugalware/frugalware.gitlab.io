Some vulnerabilities have been reported in Mozilla Firefox and Mozilla SeaMonkey, which can be exploited by malicious people to bypass certain security restrictions, conduct cross-site scripting attacks, and potentially compromise a vulnerable system.
 1) The bundled Network Security Services (NSS) library contains an incomplete fix for the RSA signature verification vulnerability reported in MFSA 2006-60.
 2) An error exists within the handling of Script objects. This can potentially be exploited to execute arbitrary JavaScript bytecode by modifying already running Script objects.
 3) Some unspecified errors in the layout engine and memory corruption errors in the JavaScript engine can be exploited to crash the application and may allow execution of arbitrary code.
 4) An unspecified error within XML.prototype.hasOwnProperty can potentially be exploited to execute arbitrary code.
