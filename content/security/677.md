Michael Santos has discovered a vulnerability in PCRE, which can be exploited by malicious people to cause a DoS (Denial of Service) or potentially compromise an application using the library.
 The vulnerability is caused due to a boundary error within the "compile\_branch()" function pcre\_compile.c. This can be exploited to cause a stack-based buffer overflow via a specially crafted regular expression.
 Successful exploitation may allow execution of arbitrary code.
