Marc Schoenefeld found an integer overflow in the way 
 TeX text formatting system processed special commands. 
 If a user was tricked into processing a specially-crafted
 typesetter-independent .dvi (DeVice Independent) file,
 it could lead to dvips executable crash or, potentially, 
 to arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the user
 running dvips.
