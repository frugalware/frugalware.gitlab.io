A vulnerability has been reported in UnZip, which potentially can be exploited by malicious people to compromise a user's system.
 The vulnerability is caused due to the use of uninitialized pointers in the "inflate\_dynamic()" function in inflate.c. This can potentially be exploited to free an attacker-controlled memory region and execute arbitrary code via a specially crafted ZIP compressed file.
 Successful exploitation may allow execution of arbitrary code.
