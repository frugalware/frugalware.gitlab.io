Some vulnerabilities have been reported in Boost, which can be exploited by malicious people to cause a DoS (Denial of Service).
 The vulnerabilities are caused due to errors within the parsing of regular expressions in boost/regex/v4/basic\_regex\_parser.hpp. These can be exploited to crash an application linked against the Boost library via specially crafted regular expressions.
