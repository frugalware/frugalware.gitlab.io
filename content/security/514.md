* Vulnerable: 1.1.22-2kalgan1
* Unaffected: 1.1.22-2kalgan2


Chris Evans has reported some vulnerabilities in libxslt, which can be exploited by malicious people to cause a DoS (Denial of Service) and potentially compromise an application using the library.
 The vulnerabilities are caused due to boundary errors within crypto.c when handling the XSLT "crypto:rc4\_encrypt" and "crypto:rc4\_decrypt" functions. This can be exploited to cause a heap-based buffer overflow via a specially crafted stylesheet.
