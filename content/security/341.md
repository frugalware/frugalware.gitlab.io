A vulnerability has been reported in Drupal, which can be exploited by malicious people to conduct SQL injection attacks.
 Input passed to the "taxonomy\_select\_nodes()" function is not properly sanitised before being used in SQL queries. This can be exploited to manipulate SQL queries by injecting arbitrary SQL code.
 Successful exploitation requires that a module that passes unsanitised data to "taxonomy\_select\_nodes()" is installed.
