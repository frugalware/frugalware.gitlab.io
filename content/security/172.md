Arnaud Giersch has reported a weakness in ELinks, which potentially can be exploited by malicious, local users to gain escalated privileges.
 The weakness is caused due to the "add\_filename\_to\_string()" function in src/intl/gettext/loadmsgcat.c reading gettext catalogs from potentially untrusted paths. This can be exploited to execute arbitrary code with escalated privileges by enticing another user to run ELinks in a specially prepared directory environment.
