Timo Warns reported multiple integer overflow vulnerabilities in libtar, a library for manipulating tar archives, which can result in the execution of arbitrary code.
 A directory traversal attack was reported against libtar, a C library for manipulating tar archives. The application does not validate the filenames inside the tar archive, allowing to extract files in arbitrary path. 
 An attacker can craft a tar file to override files beyond the tar\_extract\_glob and tar\_extract\_all prefix parameter.
