Two vulnerabilities have been reported in Wireshark, which can be exploited by malicious people to cause a DoS (Denial of Service).
 1) A boundary error in "dissect\_ldss\_transfer()" in epan/dissectors/packet-ldss.c can be exploited to cause a heap-based buffer overflow.
 2) An error in the ZigBee ZCL Discover Attribute Response dissector can be exploited to cause an infinite loop.
