Some vulnerabilities have been reported in wvWare, which can be exploited by malicious people to cause a DoS (Denial of Service) and potentially compromise an application using the library.
 The vulnerabilities are caused due to integer overflows within the "wvGetLFO\_records()" and "wvGetLFO\_PLF()" functions. These can be exploited to cause heap-based buffer overflows by e.g. tricking a user to open a specially crafted Microsoft Word document with an application using the library.
