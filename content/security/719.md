Secutity issues have been reported in the Linux kernel:
 1) The start\_code and end\_code values in "/proc/[pid]/stat" were not protected. In certain scenarios, this flaw could be used to defeat Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR).
 2) An integer signedness flaw in drm\_modeset\_ctl() could allow a local, unprivileged user to cause a denial of service or escalate their privileges.
 3) A flaw in dev\_load() could allow a local user who has the CAP\_NET\_ADMIN capability to load arbitrary modules from "/lib/modules/", instead of only netdev modules.
 4) When a DNS resolver key is instantiated with an error indication, attempts to read that key resulted in an oops because user\_read() expected there to be a payload - and there wasn't one.
