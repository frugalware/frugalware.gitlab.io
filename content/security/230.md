Two vulnerabilities have been reported in the Net::DNS Perl module, which can be exploited to poison the DNS cache or to cause a DoS (Denial of Service).
 1) An error exists in the handling of DNS queries where IDs are incremented with a fixed value and are additionally used for child processes in a forking server. This can be exploited to poison the DNS cache of an application using the module if a valid ID is guessed.
 2) An error in the PP implementation within the "dn\_expand()" function can be exploited to cause a stack overflow due to an endless loop via a specially crafted DNS packet.
