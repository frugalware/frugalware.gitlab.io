Two vulnerabilities were discovered in Fail2ban, a solution to ban hosts that cause multiple authentication errors.
 When using Fail2ban to monitor Postfix or Cyrus IMAP logs, improper input validation in log parsing could enable a remote attacker to trigger an IP ban on arbitrary addresses, resulting in denial of service.
