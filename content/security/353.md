Some vulnerabilities have been reported in ClamAV, where one vulnerability has an unknown impact and others can be exploited by malicious people to cause a DoS (Denial of Service) or compromise a vulnerable system.
 1) An integer overflow error exists within the "cli\_scanpe()" function when handling MEW packed executables. This can be exploited to cause a heap-based buffer overflow via specially crafted "ssize" and "dsize" values. Successful exploitation allows execution of arbitrary code.
 2) An off-by-one error exists within libclamav/mspack.c when handling MSZIP compressed files. This can be exploited to e.g. crash the scanner or potentially execute arbitrary code via a specially crafted MSZIP compressed file.
 3) An boundary error exists within the bzip2 "BZ\_GET\_FAST()" and "BZ\_GET\_FAST\_C()" decompression macros in libclamav/nsis/bzlib\_private.h.
