* Vulnerable: 0.9.4-2
* Unaffected: 0.9.4-3kalgan1


A security issue has been reported in Eterm, which can be exploited by malicious, local users to gain escalated privileges. Eterm 0.9.4 opens a terminal window on :0 if -display is not specified and the DISPLAY environment variable is not set, which might allow local users to hijack X11 connections. NOTE: realistic attack scenarios require that the victim enters a command on the wrong machine.
