Some vulnerabilities have been discovered in VLC Media Player, which can be exploited by malicious people to compromise a user's system.
 1) Boundary errors in the "ParseMicroDvd()", "ParseSSA()", and "ParseVplayer()" functions when handling subtitles can be exploited to cause stack-based buffer overflows.
 2) A format string error in the web interface listening on port 8080/tcp (disabled by default) can be exploited via a specially crafted HTTP request with a "Connection" header value containing format specifiers. Successful exploitation of the vulnerabilities allows execution of arbitrary code.
