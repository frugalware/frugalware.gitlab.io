Secunia Research has discovered a vulnerability in Blender, which can be exploited by malicious people to compromise a user's system.
 The vulnerability is caused due to the insecure use of the "eval()" function in kmz\_ImportWithMesh.py. This can be exploited to execute arbitrary Python commands by tricking a user into importing a specially crafted "\*.kml" or "\*.kmz" file.
