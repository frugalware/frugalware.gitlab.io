Secunia Research has discovered a vulnerability in xine-lib, which can be exploited by malicious people to compromise a user's system.
 The vulnerability is caused due to a boundary error within the "sdpplin\_parse()" function in input/libreal/sdpplin.c. This can be exploited to overwrite arbitrary memory regions via an overly large "streamid" SDP parameter included in a malicious RTSP stream.
 Successful exploitation allows execution of arbitrary code.
