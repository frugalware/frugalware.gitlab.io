Trixter Jack has reported a vulnerability in the Xvid library, which can be exploited by malicious people to compromise an application using the library.
 The vulnerability is caused due to an array indexing error in the "get\_intra\_block()" function within src/bitstream/mbcoding.c while processing Xvid Avi files. This can be exploited to corrupt memory via a specially crafted file. Successful exploitation may allow execution of arbitrary code.
