Some vulnerabilities have been reported in the Linux Kernel, which can be exploited by malicious, local users to cause a DoS (Denial of Service).
 1) Listening IPv6 TCP sockets are incorrectly sharing the "ipv6\_fl\_socklist" IPv6 flowlist with child sockets. This can be exploited to e.g. cause a kernel crash by performing certain actions on IPv6 TCP sockets.
 2) The "hrtimer\_forward()" does not correctly check for "timer->expires" overflows on 64bit machines. This can be exploited to cause a DoS by using very large timer values. Successful exploitation may require a 64bit machine and that high resolution timers are enabled.
 3) A NULL pointer dereference within the "do\_ipv6\_setsockopt()" function in net/ipv6/ipv6\_sockglue.c can be exploited to cause a kernel crash by calling "setsockopt()" with malicious parameters.
