<a name="welcome"></a>
<h2>Welcome</h2>
<p>
	You may have noticed that it's been some time since the previous newsletter (25 July, 2007 to be exact).  AlexExtreme - the previous author of the newsletter - has moved on to other projects.  Many thanks go to AlexExtreme for starting the newsletter.  I (Phayz) have taken on the task of publishing the newsletter in his place and intend carrying on his good work.  My aim is to return to a two-week release as quickly as possible.
</p>

<h2>Events</h2>
<p>
	Here's a selection of events which occurred since the previous newsletter:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		<h3>Farewell to AlexExtreme</h3>
		On 12 September, AlexExtreme (Alex) announced that he was leaving the Frugalware development team.  His other projects, school work etc meant that he was forced to choose between them.  Frugalware's loss is (hopefully) a gain to his education.  Alex's areas of contribution to Frugalware were as a package maintainer, Gnome co-maintainer and web site/wiki maintainer.  He and his contributions to the development of Frugalware will be missed.  Good luck to him for the future.
	</li>
	<li>
		<h3>Welcome to Devil505</h3>
		On 28 October, the Frugalware developers voted that Devil505 (Daniel) be welcomed to the development team.  He'd recently contributed several packages for software new to the Frugalware repository.  Welcome to Daniel and we look forward to many more packages in the future.
	</li>
	<li>
		<h3>Frugalware users have more FUN!!</h3>
		On 22 November, Priyank Gosalia announced the release to the current repository of the Frugalware Update Notifier (FUN) version 0.1.0.  FUN is a update notifier that sits in your system tray checking for new package updates at regular intervals.
	</li>

</ul>

<a name="tips"></a>
<h2>Tips and tricks</h2>
<ul>
	<li>
		<h3>KDE - configuring the clock - submitted by 'phinger'</h3>
		You may find that all the clock's configuration options are greyed out.  To fix this, remove the clock from the panel, then add it.  When you again choose the 'Configure Clock' menu option, you should find all the configuration options are available.
	</li>
</ul>
	<p>
	This section relies on your contributions! If you have some tips and tricks that you would like to be shown in the newsletter, <b><u><i>please</i></u></b> post them on the forums in the Tips and Tricks section!
