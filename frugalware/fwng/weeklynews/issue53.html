  <p>The newsletter's aim is to keep you up to date with what's happened
  recently in the world of the Linux distribution 'Frugalware'.</p>

  <p>Features of this issue include:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>What Planet are you on?</li>

    <li>Frugalware is beautiful</li>

    <li>Patches, patches and more patches from users</li>

    <li>Frugalware's users are people too</li>

    <li><strong>NEW!</strong> - FLOSS developers are people too</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Events etc</h2>

  <p>Here's a selection of events which have occurred since the previous
  newsletter:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <h3>What Planet are you on?</h3>

      <p>Devil505 and VMiklos recently made several improvements to the
      Frugalware <a href="http://planet.frugalware.org/">Planet</a>. Devil505
      has added feeds for several developers' blogs, including his own. :) He's
      also improved the look of the site, with each blog entry contained in a
      speech bubble. I really like the result of his work and I hope you do
      too. VMiklos made some changes to the code behind the site so that people
      could choose to see only blog entries in a specific language - e.g.
      French. The Planet is open to anyone's blog which features Frugalware and
      related topics. Contact Devil505 if you would like to have your own blog
      added to the feed. I encourage everyone to read the Planet entries
      regularly because there are some very interesting blog entries there.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <h3>Bouleetbil - "The Man Who Never Sleeps"</h3>

      <p>Frugalware developer Bouleetbil recently packaged Gnome 2.28. For most
      people that would be a great achievement, and a good reason to have a
      rest for a week or so. For Bouleetbil, though, it seems that he needed a
      bigger challenge. Since then, he has started packaging a newer X.org and
      PAM (pluggable authentication modules), in work-in-progress repositories,
      while still maintaining other packages. We appreciate his hard work but,
      he <strong>really</strong> needs to take a break some time soon.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <h3>Frugalware is beautiful</h3>

      <p>Devil505 recently reminded everyone via the Frugalware forum that we
      have our own site dedicated to desktop customisation - <a href=
      "http://frugalware-art.org/">http://frugalware-art.org/</a>. It features
      some fantastic Frugalware-specific wallpapers with which you can decorate
      your desktop. Be aware that some of the wallpapers feature women in very
      little clothing.</p>

      <p>The Frugalware art site is also a great place to upload a screenshot
      of your desktop. Others might like to see your desktop, particularly what
      themes you have chosen. It's a great way of discovering wallpapers and
      other themes, so <em>please</em> take a few minutes to take a screenshot
      and upload it to the site.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <h3>VMiklos is a busy, busy bee</h3>

      <p>Like several Frugalware developers, VMiklos is involved in projects
      outside Frugalware. He's the sole developer of the Bitlbee Skype plugin
      and is very active on the <a href=
      "https://launchpad.net/bzr-fastimport">Bazaar Fast Import Plugin</a>
      project. The Bitlbee Skype plugin was recently upgraded to match an
      upgraded version of Bitlbee. Congratulations to VMiklos on his excellent
      work on these projects. I don't know how he finds time to maintain
      Frugalware <strong>and</strong> these other projects. If I find out,
      though, I'll tell everyone.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <h3>KMS has been added to the kernel</h3>

      <p>On 18 October 2009, VMiklos announced that Kernel Mode Switching (KMS)
      had been added to the Frugalware kernel by default. KMS is a recent
      addition to the Linux kernel which provides a much smoother graphical
      startup. Until now, as the boot process went through each phase, the
      graphical mode could change several times. KMS is only supported on some
      Intel and Radeon video cards but if your video card is supported, KMS is
      enabled by default in the Frugalware kernel. If you prefer
      <strong>not</strong> to have a graphical boot, refer <a href=
      "http://frugalware.org/docs/upgrade#_kernel_mode_setting">here</a> for
      instructions.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <h3>Where's the wiki?</h3>

      <p>In June 2009 the official Frugalware wiki went offline and has stayed
      offline. VMiklos has a backup of its contents, so you can be glad that
      they're not lost. Work is underway to create a new wiki site, including
      old content and new content. Please be patient a little longer and the
      valuable information in the wiki will again be available.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <h3>Patches, patches and more patches from users</h3>

      <p>The developer team have recently received patches from Frugalware
      users. User 'pete' has submitted patches to documentation, about the USB
      installation option. User 'Laszlo Papp' has submitted several patches for
      pacman. Thankyou to both these people for their hard work. Contributions
      from everyone are welcome in all areas of Frugalware - design,
      documentation, packages, ideas. The easiest way to contribute something
      is usually via the forums. You can also send them to the developers'
      mailing list but to do this you must first have subscribed to the
      list.</p>

    <dd>
      <p>7 years ago. I have used Gentoo before and sometimes Ubuntu. I have
      been working as an SME server administer for the past for 5 years. I have
      been using Frugalware for the past 2 months. Why? I don't know
      really.</p>
    </dd>

    <dt><strong>What do you like most about Frugalware?</strong></dt>

    <dd>
      <p>Maybe the large number of French users and build scripts which are
      more open than --untu. The i686 optimisation!!! i386 is dead (who has a
      PentiumIII?)</p>
    </dd>

    </dd>
  </dl>

  <h2>FLOSS developers are people too</h2>

  <p>Without developers, we wouldn't have the Linux kernel and all the software
  that we run on the platform. What motivates FLOSS developers? Why does anyone
  choose to spend their time writing software when they don't get paid to do
  so? What do developers do when they're not writing software? These questions
  and more are the inspiration behind this new section of the newsletter.</p>

  <p>In interviews with FLOSS developers, we get to know them a little better
  as people, and what motivates them in their quest for better software. I'm
  very excited by this new series because I admire their work very much. I'm
  also very grateful to them for taking the time to reply to my requests.</p>

  <p>Interviews in the next few issues will feature:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Stuart Rackham - developer of ASCIIDOC;</li>

    <li>Michael Cornelius - developer of fotoxx, UKopp, picpuz and much
    more;</li>

    <li>The developer of Code Browser;</li>

    <li>Jeff Bailes - developer of Whaaw! Media Player</li>
  </ul>

  <p>This issue, we have an interview with Campbell Barton, a Blender developer
  and part of the Open Movie team. As someone who has no artistic talent, I
  admire those who produce works we can all enjoy and admire. Campbell gave
  this interview just a few days before traveling to Amsterdam to begin work on
  the next Open Movie project.</p><a href=

  <p><strong>Note:</strong> Campbell is the one in the middle.</p>

  <dl>
    <dt><strong>What's your name?</strong></dt>

    <dd>
      <p>Campbell Barton</p>
    </dd>

    <dt><strong>What's the story behind your nickname?</strong></dt>

    <dd>
      <p>Ideasman42, from the movie "The Castle", at the time it seemed clever,
      42 because it's the "answer" of course. I might change it to something
      more conservative, perhaps when I hit 30 :D.</p>
    </dd>

    <dt><strong>What FLOSS projects are you involved in?</strong></dt>

    <dd>
      <p>Almost exclusively Blender, sometimes I consider looking into other
      projects but reading the code I feel like a beginner again and there's
      really a whole world inside Blender of fun stuff to develop. I also work
      on YoFrankie but mostly maintenance so far. When I get some time Id like
      to add some fun levels and game mechanics.</p>
    </dd>

    <dt><strong>What do you like about being a FLOSS
    developer/contributor?</strong></dt>

    <dd>
      <p>I like how I can work on things that interest me. It's incredibly fun
      to explore new areas along with the normal maintenance and bug fixes.</p>

      <p>Sometimes this means addressing the needs of a specific project. Other
      times we implement user requests. It's important to me that users gain
      some value from my time.</p>

      <p>Working with the other Blender developers is also really enjoyable.
      Mostly I try not to bother other devs but it's great to have their
      support and likewise from time to time I help others.</p>
    </dd>

    <dt><strong>What don't you like about being a FLOSS
    developer/contributor?</strong></dt>

    <dd>
      <p>Resolving some technical topics over email can be tedious especially
      when you throw in a mix of supported operating systems and backwards
      compatibility.</p>

      <p>It can end up that making proposals for trivial changes require many
      qualifications and exceptions for different configurations.</p>
    </dd>

    <dt><strong>How did your involvement with Blender and the Orange Open Movie
    Project start?</strong></dt>

    <dd>
      <p>I started working at a simulation company using Blender as a technical
      artist, writing scripts and extending Blender when necessary. I ended up
      using Blender to automate their asset library pipeline. I was asked to be
      involved with Big Buck Bunny. Whilst I'd never worked on a movie before,
      being an active contributor meant it wasn't such a big change.</p>
    </dd>

    <dt><strong>What motivates you to work on Blender?</strong></dt>

    <dd>
      <p>I'm mainly motivated by the fact that people use Blender for really
      interesting projects (games, simulations, experiments, artwork, music
      videos), Its great that every so often I can solve problems that used to
      annoy me as a user. OpenMovies are a great way to stay in touch with
      practical issues and focus on problems artists have day to day.</p>
    </dd>

    <dt><strong>What do you do outside the FLOSS world?</strong></dt>

    <dd>
      <p>Sometimes I try to get other interests like facebook, bike riding or a
      good video game but don't find them that engaging. so... Spend time with
      my lovely family, not much else.</p>
    </dd>

    <dt><strong>What operating system(s) do you use and why?</strong></dt>

    <dd>
      <p>Arch Linux, on my main system. I like having access to the latest
      tools especially for development and like how it handles package
      management. It's relatively simple and the packages themselves only have
      minimal changes made. I'm a big fan of rolling releases which haven't
      broken my system or put me through dependency hell.</p>

      <p>Before Arch I was on Slackware which was alright but I ended up
      compiling a lot of software which was great for learning but became time
      consuming.</p>

      <p>Other PCs my family use run Ubuntu because it's easiest for them to
      use.</p>
    </dd>

    <dt><strong>If people are interested in helping your project(s), how might
    they do this?</strong></dt>

    <dd>
      <p>If you're interested in 3D graphics get your feet wet by trying out
      Blender. If you get past the learning curve and continue with it you
      might want to help improve some areas, whether it be code, scripts, docs
      or UI work. Otherwise if you're interested to dive right into
      development, join the mailing list, download the source, compile it and
      start looking into the code which you'd like to work on. See
      http://www.Blender.org/community/get-involved/</p>
    </dd>

    <dt><strong>Is there anything else you think people might be interested to
    know?</strong></dt>

    <dd>
      <p>My background is in multimedia (very 90's term!). I am self-taught in
      C &amp; Python (a little C++ too).I use the Eclipse and Scite
      editors.</p>
    </dd>

  <h2>Getting To Know You</h2>

  <p>In this section of the newsletter, we get to know Frugalware Linux a
  little at a time. This is not meant to replace the official documentation but
  instead make it easier to read. This should suit those those people who, like
  me, have short attention spans. :)</p>

  <h3>Mirrors</h3>

  <p>Frugalware is lucky to have many package mirrors around the world, all
  hosted for free. Because of differences in bandwidth available, timing of
  synchronisation and other factors, not all mirrors are up to date. When
  pacman-g2 is trying to download a package, it will try to download it from
  the first mirror listed in its configuration file. If the package's file is
  not available, it will repeat the request for each mirror, in the order
  they're listed in pacman-g2's configuration file. In this way, you don't have
  to worry about the status of the various mirrors because pacman-g2 looks
  after this for you.</p>

  <h2>New Packages</h2>

  <p>Here are some highlights from new packages added to the 'current'
  repository since the previous newsletter issue.</p>

      to communicate with the server through the publicly available flickr REST
      API." <em>Editor's note:</em> I have checked the list of developers of
      Frogr and was surprised to find that Bouleetbil is not part of the team.

  <h2>Tips and tricks</h2>

  <p><b>Disclaimer</b> - Be aware that the hints &amp; tips provided here have
  NOT been tested and so come with no warranty.</p>

  <h3>Don't be afraid to make mistakes</h3>

  <p>Sometimes you might not try to do something because you're afraid of
  making mistakes. It's a fact, though, that mistakes are a natural and normal
  part of life. The real test of a person is not how many mistakes they make,
  but how they react. It's best to be honest with yourself, admit your mistake,
  then work out how you can fix it and avoid making similar mistakes in the
  future.</p>

  <p>The FLOSS world is one where this is very important because the emphasis
  is on being <strong>open</strong>. Source code, artwork, and translations are
  publicly available, and so any mistake is also publicly visible. Don't let
  this hold you back from contributing to a project, any project. Instead focus
  on your end goal, admit your mistakes when they happen, and learn from
  them.</p>

  <h3>Gnome terminal's tabs</h3>

  <p>Like other terminal emulator's Gnome's Terminal offers a tabbed interface,
  allowing you to have multiple consoles open without using too much screen
  real estate. Sometimes though you may have two consoles open and decide that
  instead you need them arranged side by side, not within the same window. You
  can solve this quite easily by dragging and dropping one of the tabs to an
  area outside Terminal's window. The tab being dragged will separate from the
  original window and have its own window decorations.</p>

  <p>This section relies on your contributions! If you have some tips and tricks
  that you would like to be shown in the newsletter, <em>please</em> post them
  on the forums.</p>

  <h2>Focus On Package(s)</h2>

  <h3>top</h3>

  <p>top is a console real-time system resources monitor which shows details of
  the processes active on your system and their overall load. It's a classic
  utility available on all Linux and Unix-like systems. Its problem is that
  it's not very intuitive to use. If you have nothing else available, then of
  course use it. If you do have a choice, then you might prefer the application
  below - 'htop'.</p><a href=
  "http://frugalware.org/images/newsletter/issue53_top_screenshot.jpg"><img src="http://frugalware.org/images/newsletter/issue53_top_screenshot_t.jpg"
  alt="Screenshot of system utility top"></a>

  <h3>htop</h3>

  <p><a href="http://htop.sourceforge.net/">htop</a> is a console real-time
  system resources monitor which is much easier to use than top. Graphical
  resource monitors, such as those which are part of the GNOME and KDE desktop
  environments are also easy to use but they have one problem: they use a lot
  of system resources. htop is an ncurses application which means it uses few
  resources itself, but still presents its information in an easy-to-understand
  interface. The interface consists of three sections, as you can see in the
  following screenshot. The upper section displays live bars which indicate
  total memory and CPU load. The middle section displays live statistics of
  individual processes. The lower section displays htop's menu, which is driven
  by function keys, and allows you to change htop's layout or take action on
  one ore more procesessesthe sort order of processes, also the format in which
  the information is displayed. When (not if) you need a system resources
  monitor, you can rely on htop to give you the information you need without
  putting a heavy load on your system.</p><a href=
