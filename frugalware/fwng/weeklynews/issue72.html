  <p>Here's a selection of recent events and other items that you might find
  interesting:</p>

  <h3>kikadf is officially a Frugalware developer</h3>

  <p>Frugalware user kikadf successfully submitted FrugalBuilds for packages
  such as Launchy, Kupfer, DeaDBeeF and aTunes. The quality of his work was so
  good that it usually needed only a review before being accepted. Developer
  VMiklos suggested that kikadf become an official member of the development
  team and called for the votes of other developers. Everyone voted "Yes", so
  kikadf is officially a member of the Frugalware development team.
  Congratulations!</p>

  <h3>Botchchikii submits more FrugalBuilds</h3>

  <p>In newsletter issue 71 I pointed out that Frugalware user Botchchikii had
  submitted his very first FrugalBuild for QTM. With only minor changes that
  was quickly accepted and added to the 'current' repository. He now has plans
  to package Calibre, an e-book reader but it has two main dependencies -
  Podofo and Pypdf - that needed to be packaged first. FrugalBuilds for both
  have now been submitted, with Pypdf already having been accepted. If Podofo
  is also accepted we'll probably see Calibre packaged for Frugalware soon.
  Many thanks to Botchchikii for his excellent work.</p>

  <h3>"The goal of the game is ... to win Muhaawhahaha"</h3>

  <p>This quote is from Frugalware user fbiot, who recently submitted
  FrugalBuilds for two new applications: tiled and MisfitModel3D. tiled is "a
  general purpose tile 2D and iso map editor" and MisfitModel3D is a 3D model
  editor. He is using both applications in developing a new game named
  Satowerdefense, to be released under a GPL licence. You can take a look at
  what he's already achieved at the Sourceforge site - <a href=
  "http://sourceforge.net/projects/satowerdefense/">http://sourceforge.net/projects/satowerdefense/</a>.
  There is more work to be done, but the game is playable and already looks
  good. When the first release is done, he plans to use OpenGL to give the game
  a 3D look, and this is where MisfitModel3D is required. Below is a screenshot
  of one of the first models he has created with MisfitModel3D, which I think
  looks great.</p><img src="http://frugalware.org/images/newsletter/issue72_misfitmodel3d_plane.png" alt=

  <h3>Control your PC from your phone</h3>

  <p>Frugalware developer VMiklos recently packaged <a href=
  "http://sourceforge.net/projects/anyremote">anyremote</a>, which allows you to
  control your computer from your phone. Using only your phone you can carry
  out actions simply and easily for which you would normally use your mouse or
  keyboard. Here's a table of common keyboard functions and the matching
  'anyremote' keycodes:</p>

  <table border="1" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0">
    <tr>
      <th>Function</th>

      <th>Keycode</th>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>Up Arrow</td>

      <td>5757509789</td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>Down Arrow</td>

      <td>9276786263</td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>Page Up</td>

      <td>6389789268</td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>Page Down</td>

      <td>2786716862</td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>Enter</td>

      <td>7367778682</td>
    </tr>
  </table>

  <p>As you can see from these examples, you can save a lot of time with
  'anyremote'. Instead of pressing just one key on your keyboard, you can
  instead enter a 10-digit sequence on your phone. With most keyboards having
  over 100 keys, that's over 100 10-digit sequences to remember. Doesn't that
  sound like fun! :P Please try it for yourself because I'm sure you will
  either love it...or curse VMiklos, forever.</p>

  <p><b>Disclaimer</b> - Be aware that the hints &amp; tips provided here have
  NOT been tested and so come with no warranty.</p>

  <h3>Adding a custom Frugalware repository to pacman-g2's configuration</h3>

  <p>pacman-g2 allows you to add to its configuration a custom Frugalware
  repository, such as a developer's work in progress (WIP) repository. The
  format in which the configuration lines must be added is detailed in
  pacman-g2's configuration file. The name of the repository must be surrounded
  with square brackets - '[' and ']'. When pacman-g2 downloads the list of
  packages contained in a repository, it downloads a file named the same as the
  repository's name, with a suffix of ".fdb". If you don't have the
  repository's name right, pacman-g2 won't be able to download the package list
  and so you won't be able to install any of its packages. How do I know this?
  Because I once typed the name of a repository incorrectly and so couldn't
  install packages. Thankfully I soon found my error. :)</p>

  <p>This section relies on your contributions! If you have some tips and
  tricks that you would like to be shown in the newsletter, <em>please</em>
  post them on the forums.</p>

  <h3>QTM</h3>

  <p>According to its home page, "<a href="http://qtm.blogistan.co.uk/">QTM</a>
  is a blogging client which is presently capable of composing, formatting and
  submitting blog entries to a weblog. QTM will work with blogs based on most
  of the major blogging systems available today: Wordpress (including
  wordpress.com), Movable Type, Drupal and so on." Using a blogging client
  instead of the native interface offers advantages such as independence from
  the blogging engine, the ability to write blog entries offline and desktop
  integration. QTM provides a functional, attractive and easy-to-use interface,
  with all the features you need to maintain your blog. If you blog on one of
  the many supported blogging platforms, try QTM.</p>

  <h3>cclive</h3>

  <p><a href="http://code.google.com/p/cclive/">cclive</a> is "a free,
  no-nonsense, command line tool that will help you download videos from
  YouTube and similar video-sharing websites." Sites like YouTube offer an
  amazing number of videos, ranging from completely silly to educational. These
  sites provide an embedded Flash-based player, which requires you to have a
  Flash plugin installed in your browser, either the proprietary plugin from
  Adobe or Gnash, the FLOSS replacement. An even better option is to download
  the video with cclive and watch it whenever you choose, with whatever video
  player you choose.</p>

  <p>cclive has a single purpose, and the developer emphasises this, saying it
  "is not, nor intended to become, "an universal" flash video download tool."
  However on the web site are links to other tools which work well together
  with cclive, including:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>grake -- Youtube link scanner</li>

    <li>gcap -- Youtube closed captions</li>

    <li>umph -- Youtube playlists</li>
  </ul>
