  <h2><img src="http://frugalware.org/images/newsletter/event.png" align=
  "left">Events etc</h2>

  <p>Here's a selection of events which have occurred since the previous
  newsletter:</p>

  <h3>Does your favourite editor support FrugalBuild files?</h3>

  <p>Frugalware developer ryuo is working to enable syntax highlighting for
  FrugalBuild files in all text editors packaged in Frugalware. If your
  favourite editor doesn't already have this feature, please post a feature
  request in the Frugalware Bug Tracker System.</p>

  <h3>GNOME 2.30 is available in 'current'</h3>

  <p>The GNOME team recently announced the release of the latest in the 2.x
  series - 2.30. Soon after, Frugalware developer bouleetbil announced that he
  had started packaging it. GNOME is a complex collection of packages, so it
  takes a lot of effort to upgrade all the FrugalBuilds required. Bouleetbil
  made it look easy, however, and it's now available in the 'current'
  repository.</p>

  <h3>Turkish translation has started</h3>

  <p>Tutku "Titus" DALMAZ has started the task of translating the various
  Frugalware projects into Turkish. This is great news for Frugalware because
  it provides easier access to Turkish speakers. More translations are always
  welcome because one of Frugalware's earliest goals was to provide
  multi-lingual distribution. Thankyou, Titus for starting this work and we
  hope to hear about your progress soon.</p>

  <h3>The battle of the game packagers has begun!</h3>

  <p>Adrien Ramos recently submitted a new FrugalBuild for a game and in the
  commit comment was "New package : a game, I want to dethrone devil505 for the
  games! Ahahah!". This is the first time anyone has challenged another
  packager, so it was an interesting move. Devil505 has packaged many games
  though, so Adrien has a lot of work to do. Let's hope that there's not too
  much bloodshed in the battle to come. :P</p>

  <h3>GNOME is asking for money</h3>

  <p>The GNOME foundation recently started a <a href=
  "http://www.gnome.org/friends/">campaign</a>, asking people and companies for
  money to employ a sysadmin "so that GNOME developers can focus on GNOME."
  Their goal is to raise $32,000 and with the help of many companies and
  individual contributors, they have almost reached this goal. If you use
  GNOME, please consider making a contribution.</p>

  <h3>No FLOSS developer interview in this issue</h3>

  <p>There is no FLOSS developer interview in this issue because there was none
  available. I am keen to continue the series though, so look out for an
  interview in the next issue.</p>

  <h2><img src="http://frugalware.org/images/newsletter/community.png" align=
  "left">Frugalware's users are people too!</h2>

  <p>This is the latest in the ongoing series of interviews with Frugalware's
  users. Even though we have at least one thing in common - our use of
  Frugalware - everyone has a different, interesting story to tell.</p>

  <h2><img src="http://frugalware.org/images/newsletter/tip.png" align=
  "left">Tips and tricks</h2>

  <p><b>Disclaimer</b> - Be aware that the hints &amp; tips provided here have
  NOT been tested and so come with no warranty.</p>

  <h3>Tell me when you're finished</h3>

  <p>When you're working in a CLI you sometimes have to wait for something to
  finish. It might be a file download, or burning an image to a CD or DVD.
  Instead of staring at the screen while waiting for the task to finish, you
  can have your computer tell you when it's complete.</p>
  <p>You can have a
  favourite audio clip played when the command is finished, simply by adding
  "&amp;&amp; play audio_clip" at the end of the command. This requires the sox
  package installed. You might prefer a popup message on the screen and to do
  this simply add "&amp;&amp; notify-send message -t 0" at the end of the
  command. The "-t 0" parameter means that the popup message will remain
  displayed until it's clicked on. This requires the libnotify package
  installed and popup notifications enabled. The "&amp;&amp;" parameter tells
  bash that the command which follows it is to be run only when the first
  command is complete.</p>

  <p>As an example, you want an audio clip played when a wget command is
  complete:</p>

  <p>
    <pre>wget http://www.mirror.com/frugalware.iso &amp;&amp; play ~/audio/complete.ogg</pre>
  </p>

  <p>In another example, you want a pop-up notification when a "git pull" is
  complete:</p>

  <p>
    <pre>git pull &amp;&amp; notify-send "git pull is complete" -t 0</pre>
  </p>

  <p>These are just examples of ways in which you can get on with other tasks
  while a long-running task completes in the background. A simple search of
  the Internet will reveal many more ways of achieving the same goal, with some
  being more complex than others.</p>

  <p>This section relies on your contributions! If you have some tips and
  tricks that you would like to be shown in the newsletter, <em>please</em>
  post them on the forums.</p>

  <h3>Pino</h3>

  <p>Pino is a microblogging client which is compatible with Twitter and, more
  importantly, Status.net sites such as identi.ca. It has a clear, easy user
  interface but it has a great range of features without being bloated. It's
  still under heavy development, with additional features being added with each
  release and bugs being hunted down and squashed. If you use either the
  Twitter or Status.net services, please try Pino, even if you currently use
  another client.</p>
