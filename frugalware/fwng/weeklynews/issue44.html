<h2>Frugalware Linux Newsletter - Issue 44</h2>

<h2>...to inform...to educate...to entertain</h2>

<p>"Look at life through the windshield, not the rear-view mirror"<em>  Byrd
Baggett</em></p>


<h2>Welcome</h2>
<p>The newsletter's aim is to keep you up to date with what's happened recently
in the world of the Linux distribution 'Frugalware'.</p>

<p>Features of this issue include:
    <ul>
        <li>Frugalware 1.1pre1 was released</li>
        <li>Frugalware 1.1 is coming - let's party!</li>
        <li>Frugalware's artists are people too - leo</li>
	<li>Focus On Package(s) - chm2pdf and Open ClipArt Library</li>
    </ul>
</p>


<h2>Events</h2>

<p>Here's a selection of events which have occurred since the previous
newsletter:</p>

<ul>
    <li>
	<h3>Frugalware 1.1pre1 was released</h3>
	<p>On 12 May 2009, VMiklos announced that 1.1pre1 had been released.
	This is a technical preview, allowing users to test for bugs, and see
	what new features have been added.  Congratulations to the
	development team on their hard work.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h3>Frugalware 1.1 is coming - let's party!</h3>
        <p>With the final release of 1.1 due on 1 September 2009, I'm arranging
	the release party, at which we can all relax and celebrate another
	milestone.  The French development team hosted the 1.0 release party,
	in the garage of Hermier's home.  It would have been quite comfortable,
	because Hermier's home is actually a small castle, located in a
	beautiful area in France.  Unfortunately the event was held in his
	garage, but he didn't move his cars!  It was quite difficult fitting 16
	people into just 2 Citroën sedans, but with the help of tar and bzip,
	everyone fitted in.  Every time someone took a drink, either the car
	alarm started, the windscreen wipers came on, or the horn beeped.
	Despite these problems, everyone had a good time.</p>
        <p>For release 1.1 we will hold the event via IRC so that all
	Frugalware users can enjoy the celebrations.  We'll arrange a time in
	the Frugalware users' channel when everyone is to join.  You will then
	need to describe what you're doing, to encourage a party "feeling".
	Example messages might include "having a sip of my beer", "eating some
	potato chips", and "my boss is wondering what i'm doing".  For those
	drinking alcohol, the messages will probably become more and more like
	Hungarian, which will hopefully make Hungarian users feel more welcome.
	</p>
        <p>Further announcements will be made closer to the release date.
	Although it's still a few months away, I hope you're beginning to feel
	the excitement.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h3>Will all geeks please raise their hands?</h3>
        <p>VMiklos, if you haven't already got your hand up, please raise it,
	because this message is for you.  On 27 April 2009, VMiklos wrote in a
	change message - "forgot to pkgrel++".  Instead of writing "Forgot to
	increase the pkgrel's value by 1", he used a C language statement,
	proving again that he's a "geek's geek".  :)   If he wasn't, we
	wouldn't be using Frugalware, so let's be grateful he's a geek.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h3>Bunker photo</h3>
        <p>In issue 40, Fanch said in his user interview that he couldn't
	provide a photo of where he was because it was "a bunker atmosphere".
	He's now changed his mind and provided
	<a href="http://frugalware.org/images/interviews/fanch_view.png"/>
	this</a> photo.</p>
    </li>
</ul>

<h2>Frugalware's artists are people too - leo</h2>

<p>I recently had the idea of interviewing the members of the Frugalware artwork
team.  This is a quite new team but they've already produced some great work. I
can only draw stick people so I'm impressed by those who have artistic talent.
Their role is to make Frugalware look good and this is not quite as easy as you
might think.  I hope you enjoy this series of interviews.</p>

<dl>
<dt><strong>What's your name?</strong></dt>
    <p>My name is Léo Tomas.</p>

<dt><strong>What's your IRC/forum nickname?</strong></dt>
    <p>I'm known as leo209, leo or eggsite.</p>

<dt><strong>In what country do you live?</strong></dt>
    <p>I live in France.</p>

<dt><strong>In what country were you born?</strong></dt>
    <p>I was born in France.</p>

<dt><strong>Have you always been artistic?</strong></dt>
    <p>I've always produced "art" with a computer. I was born with computers so,
    to me, there's no more powerful tool!</p>

<dt><strong>Do you create artwork in other forms - sculpture, painting
etc?</strong></dt>
    <p>Yes, I do create in other forms. Well, in one other form : I make music
    (most of the time with my computer) or sometimes with my guitar but I'm not
    actually good at playing the guitar :s</p>

<dt><strong>What operating system(s) do you use when creating artwork?
</strong></dt>
    <p>I used to use Windows of course, but for about 1 year, I've only used
    Linux. At the beginning it was Ubuntu and now it's Frugalware!</p>

<dt><strong>What software do you use to create artwork?</strong>
</dt>
    <p>There are not many artistic applications on Linux. But those that exist
    are, I think, great. So I use the GIMP and Inkscape all the time... and also
    agave.</p>

<dt><strong>Why have you created artwork for Frugalware?</strong></dt>
    <p>Frugalware is my main operating system, and as I know the community is
    actually friendly.</p>

<h2>Getting To Know You</h2>

<p>In this section of the newsletter, we get to know Frugalware Linux a little
at a time.  This is not meant to replace the official documentation but instead
make it easier to read.  This should suit those those people who, like me, have
short attention spans.  :)</p>

<h3>Tell your friends...</h3>
<p>...tell your family; in fact, tell everyone!  This time I'm not writing about
Frugalware itself, but what you can do for Frugalware.  Since you use
Frugalware, why not tell your friends, family, work colleagues about your
preferred Linux distribution?  You could, for example, print out the Frugalware
logo and stick it on a notepad, your desk at work, anywhere.  If your local
library allows you, burn a copy of the Frugalware DVD or CD ISOs (perhaps just
CDs 1 and 2) and give them to the library to lend to others.  Why not add the
Frugalware slogan to your email signature?  If you're a member of a
non-Frugalware forum, you could add the slogan to your forum profile's
signature.</p>
<p>Look at the web site <a href="http://frugalware-art.org">
frugalware-art.org</a> for inspiration and examples of promotional material,
including CD/DVD label and cover artwork, Frugalware user bars (for display on
web sites).  Together we can have people all over the world saying "Let's make
things Frugal"!  In the future we hope to have even more promotional material.
</p>


<h2>Tips and tricks</h2>

<b>Disclaimer</b> - Be aware that the hints &amp; tips provided here have NOT
been tested and so come with no warranty.

<ul>
    <li>
        <h3>Oh! What a cute little wiki!</h3>
        <p><a href="http://tiddlywiki.com/">TiddlyWiki</a> is an amazing
	self-contained wiki written in Javascript.  It's best used as a personal
	wiki since there is no access control.  It's proven to be very popular,
	with many "extensions" written to enhance its functionality.  Because of
	its design, it's not multiuser-capable, but with a little care it can be
	shared on a LAN.  A company named OsmoSoft (now owned by BT - British
	Telecom) is funding the development of ccTiddly, a multi-user derivative
	of TiddlyWiki, with version 1.8.1 having been released recently.
	If you want to store notes (and images) about various topics, please
	try TiddlyWiki.  Since it's written in JavaScript, its only dependency
	is a JavaScript-capable browser.  Compare this with software like TomBoy
	which, although it's excellent, is heavy on dependencies.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h3>What time is it in Timbuctoo?</h3>
        <p>I live on the other side of the world from my of the Frugalware
	developers and contributors.  So when I'm on IRC there's a big
	difference between my local time and theirs.  I needed to know at any
	time the local time in their countries.  After a little searching I had
	a few options but I didn't like any of them.  There's a Google Gadget,
	also a KDE tool which would both achieve what I wanted.  I run Xfce
	however and wanted the solution to be light on resources and have few
	dependencies.</p>
        <p>I chose to set up <a href="http://conky.sourceforge.net/">Conky</a>
	to display the local times in various cities.  Conky displays its output
	on the desktop so, while the information I need is always there, it
	doesn't take up any screen space.  The configuration is quite simple,
	with Conky configured to run a shell script.  I cut-and-pasted the
	script from a web site, so all credit goes to its author, not me.</p>
        <p>Here's are the lines added to Conky's configuration file to run the
	script:</p>
            <p><code>TEXT</br>
            ${exec ~/git/misc_scripts/worldtimes.sh}</br>
            </code></p>
        <p>The script itself is very simple:</p>
            <p><code>
            #!/bin/sh<br />
            TZ=Europe/Budapest date +"France/Hungary/Germany :: %a %I:%M %p"<br />
            TZ=Europe/London date +"England :: %a %I:%M %p"<br />
            TZ=Asia/Calcutta date +"Mumbai :: %a %I:%M %p"<br />
            </code></p>
        <p>Note that there's a list of all available timezones is in
	/usr/share/zoneinfo.</p>
    </li>
</ul>

<p>This section relies on your contributions! If you have some tips and tricks
that you would like to be shown in the newsletter, <em>please</em> post them on
the forums.</p>


<h2>Focus On Package(s)</h2>

<h3>chm2pdf</h3>
<p>On-line documentation is often provided in the CHM format, most often in the
Windows world.  <a href="http://code.google.com/p/chm2pdf/">chm2pdf</a>
does exactly what its names suggests - it converts a CHM format file into PDF
format.  PDF is a more common, cross-platform format and so you may prefer it
over CHM.</p>

<h3>Open ClipArt Library</h3>
<p><a href="http://www.openclipart.org/">The Open ClipArt Library</a> "aims
to create an archive of user contributed clip art that can be freely used. All
graphics submitted to the project should be placed into the Public Domain
according to the statement by the Creative Commons."</p>


<h2>Bug fixes</h2>
