<p>Here's a selection of events which have occurred since the previous newsletter:</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        <h3>Frugalware 0.9 (Solaria) Release Candidate 1 is released</h3>
        <p>On 12 August 2008, Frugalware 0.9 RC1 was released.  Highlights include: GNU C Library 2.8, Firefox 3.0.1 and OpenOffice.org 2.4.1.  Refer to VMiklos' <a href="http://www.frugalware.org/news/107">announcement</a> for further details.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h3>Host 'genesis' gets more disk space</h3>
        <p>Thanks to donations from Frugalware fans and Distrowatch, extra hard drives were recently added to 'genesis', which provides the following services: homepage, primary dns server, ftp - anon upload and primary distribution site, rsync, mailing lists.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h3>Wallpaper competition is now closed</h3>
        <p>On 9 August 2008, the Frugalware wallpaper competition closed.  Several entries were received and voting is currently underway.  Once a decision is made - due on 16 August 2008 - the winner will be announced.  The winning entry will be the default wallpaper for Frugalware release 0.9.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h3>Hermier comes to the rescue</h3>
        <p>Everyone makes mistakes and I have made a few in the newsletter over the time I've been writing it. :( Thankfully others are checking what I do and correct my mistakes.  Hermier has been very helpful in correcting mistakes in the past 2 newsletters so - many thanks to him for his help.  I hope he'll have less work to do in the future.  :)</p>

<a name="gettingtoknowyou"><h2>Getting To Know You</h2></a>

    <p>In this new section of the newsletter, we get to know Frugalware Linux a little at a time.  This is not meant to replace the official documentation but instead break it down into smaller pieces.  This should help those people who, like me, have a short attention span and/or are easily distracted.  "Oh look!  Something shiny." :)</p>

    <h3>Frugalware's goals</h3>
    <p>As an introduction, let's look at the goals of the Frugalware Linux project.  As described in the official documentation,
    Frugalware's aims are "simplicity, multimedia, design. We try to make Frugalware as simple as possible while not forgetting to keep it comfortable for the user."  An early goal <em>had</em> been to get funding by winning the Eurovision Song Contest but this was quickly abandoned when in the first practice session in a karaoke bar, VMiklos' singing was heard. :)</p>


<a name="tips"><h2>Tips and tricks</h2></a>

        <h3>"Where the heck is that file?" - submitted by 'phayz'</h3>
        <p>Having installed a package you sometimes need to know exactly where it's put a file.  Many packages include an example config file.  You're expected to copy this file to your home directory and modify it to suit your needs.  The first step - finding the example file - can be made easier with pacman-g2.  The command "pacman-g2 -Ql &lt;package&gt;" when entered in a console, outputs a list of all the files contained in the specified package, including the folder in which they're located.  To make the output easier to read you can pipe it through a pager - e.g. less or more - or to a file and then view it in an editor.</p>

    <p>This section relies on your contributions! If you have some tips and tricks that you would like to be shown in the newsletter, <em>please</em> post them on the forums.</p>


<a name="packages"><h2>Focus On Package(s)</h2></a>

    <h3><a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/linkchecker">LinkChecker</a></h3>
        <p>As Bob Dylan once sang - "Oh the times, they are a changin'".  If he'd been a geek, that may have been "Oh the web pages, they are a changin'".  If you publish something to the web you should regularly check that the links you provide are valid and Linkchecker is a tool to do just that.  It's a command-line utility which, given a URL and a few parameters, checks a web page and its links to confirm that they're valid.  To ensure that you check your web site(s) regularly you could even schedule LinkChecker.</p>

<a name="fixes"><h2>Bug fixes</h2></a>

    <p>The following table gives you a overview of activity on bugs and feature requests as at 14 August 2008.  In each cell of the table is a link to a detailed list of the relevant bugs or feature requests.</p>

<a name="security"><h2>Security announcements</h2></a>

    <p><b>Remember</b> - According to the normal support arrangements for Frugalware, the release of 0.8 ("Kalgan") means that support for the previous release has ended.  This means that no further security or bug fixes will be released for Frugalware 0.7 ("Sayshell").</p>

    <p>There have been <em>no</em> <a href="/security">security issues</a> discovered and fixed in the 0.8 release since the previous newsletter.</p>
