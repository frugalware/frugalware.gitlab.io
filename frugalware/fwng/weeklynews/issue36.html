<a name="events"><h2>Events</h2></a>

<p>Here's a selection of events which have occurred since the previous newsletter:</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        <h3>Anacreon's wallpapers are complete</h3>
        <p>The Frugalware artwork team has created a <a href="http://frugalware.org/~devil505/artwork10/wallpapers.html">collection</a> of original wallpapers, from which the default for Anacreon will be selected by the development team.  The selection criteria are still being decided upon.  I'm really pleased that we have such a range of interesting and original wallpapers from which to choose.  Each wallpaper has its source files available, as is required by the <a href="http://www.frugalware.org/docs/stable/artwork-rules.html">Frugalware artwork rules</a>.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h3>mxw - the lonely little bot :(</h3>
        <p>In a dark corner of the Frugalware world (IRC), lives a lonely little bot named mxw.  He has a few jobs, including telling visitors what his best friend, "git", has been doing.  If he's happy he'll even entertain visitors with a dance.  Sadly for mxw there's not been much dancing recently.  He gets his energy by feeding on stray pixels from smilies that visitors leave behind.  His problem is that there haven't been many visitors recently and so mxw's energy levels are very low.  Please help him by getting into one or more of the IRC channels and leaving a smiley or two.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h3>Thanks for 2008</h3>
        <p>As the end of 2008 gets closer, it's a good time to say thanks for the year's achievements.</p>
        <p>Highlights of the year for me include:
            <ul>
                <li>Upgrades to all major desktop environments - Gnome, KDE and XFCE;</li>
                <li>New developers - bouleetbil, gholafox, ryuo;</li>
                <li>The establishment of the artwork team.</li>
            </ul></p>
        <p>The development team has continued to provide packages that are current and of excellent quality.  A few changes have been made to the "engine" of Frugalware, but stability remains a top priority.  It amazes me that this is all achieved by a small team of volunteers.  Many thanks to all current and past developers for their hard work.</p>
        <p>It's also a good time to thank all those outside the development team who contribute to Frugalware's success.  These people include all translators and those who maintain local Frugalware web sites (actually, they're usually the same people).  Translation is not, perhaps, the most exciting work but it's valuable because it allows more people to use Frugalware.  Thanks also to the artwork team for their excellent work.  It's great that we can present such a professional "face" to the world.</p>
        <p>It's been little more than a year that I've been writing the newsletter.  It continues to be a learning journey for me and I'm grateful for all the support I've received, especially from VMiklos and Devil505.  Without their help I probably would have given up publishing the newsletter.  I now have direct write access to the git repo so that I can publish the newsletter directly (insert evil laugh :P) and I value the trust placed in me.  Thanks again to all translators of the newsletter.  It's amazing that they can understand my writing enough to translate it.  :)</p>

<a name="interview"><h2>Frugalware's developers are people too - gholafox</h2></a>

<p>This issue's interview is with gholafox, the developer with a thousand nicknames.  :)  OK, so it's not quite that many.  Please read on...</p>

<dl>
    <dt><strong>What's your name?</strong></dt>
    <dd><p>My name is Thomas.</p></dd>

    <dt><strong>What's your IRC nickname?</strong></dt>
    <dd><p>I have got many IRC nicknames. It could be Fox, jedifox, gholafox or Echuu Fox.  But I prefer gholafox because it is the only nickname which does not appear with other people when I type it on Google.  :-P</p></dd>

    <dt><strong>In what country do you live?</strong></dt>
    <dd><p>I live in France.</p></dd>

    <dt><strong>In what country were you born?</strong></dt>
    <dd><p>The same where I live : France.  :-P</p></dd>

    <dt><strong>What do you like the most about where you live (the town/city and country)?</b></strong></dt>
    <dd><p>First, I like my city (Troyes) because there is a school where I am studying to become a computer science engineer.  Then, there is a media library where I join my girlfriend to do homework on Wednesdays.  My friends had to go to other town/cities to do their studies...</p></dd>

    <dt><strong>What do you do for the Frugalware project?</strong></dt>
    <dd><p>I just make and maintain packages.</p></dd>

    <dt><strong>What motivates you to work on Frugalware?</strong></dt>
    <dd><p>I think it is the most important question :-P  When I joined the Frugalware community, I was impressed by the distribution itself, and the French community which was very very small.  Devil505 encouraged me to make a package and this became a fun activity so that I, with Devil505's advice, sent my FrugalBuild to the developers' mailing list.  So I work on Frugalware because the community is very cool, developers too, not forgetting the youth of the distribution.  I could not ask for support in using Frugalware without also helping.</p></dd>

    <dt><strong>What do you do when you're not working on Frugalware?</strong></dt>
    <dd><p>Oh, uh... School? Or girlfriend, or playing video games. (Tick the right answer). :-P</p></dd>

    <dt><strong>What's the view from your front door?</strong></dt>
    <dd><p>Oh, <a href="http://frugalware.org/images/interviews/gholafox.jpg">this</a> is the view today but maybe this will change tomorrow. :-)</p></dd>

<a name="gettingtoknowyou"><h2>Getting To Know You</h2></a>

    <p>In this section of the newsletter, we get to know Frugalware Linux a little at a time.  This is not meant to replace the official documentation but instead make it easier to read.  This should suit those those people who, like me, have short attention spans.  :)</p>

    <h3>What's in a name?</h3>
    <p>Frugalware's package naming convention is quite simple but it's different from the one used by other distributions, including Ubuntu.  The naming convention has 3 parts, in the following order:</p>
    <p>
        <ol>
            <li>application/library name (sourced from upstream, unless it conflicts with the name of an existing package)</li>
            <li>application/library version number (sourced from upstream)</li>
            <li>Frugalware package revision number</li>
        </ol>
    </p>
    <p>Let's look at the name of the CUPS package, for example.  It's named cups-1.3.9-1, so this is revision 1 of the cups package, upstream version 1.3.9.  If a package is upgraded upstream, the Frugalware revision number starts again from 1.</p>
    <p><em>Note:</em> anyone who thinks that the revision number should start from 0 probably needs to spend a little more time away from their PC.  ;P</p>


<a name="tips"><h2>Tips and tricks</h2></a>

    <b>Disclaimer</b> - Be aware that the hints &amp; tips provided here have NOT been tested and so come with no warranty.
<ul>
    <li>
        <h3>SciTE - submitted by phayz</h3>
        <p>SciTE - a text editor - displays its in-built toolbar icons by default and they're not very good looking.  If you add the option "toolbar.usestockicons=1" to the user's configuration file, the toolbar will use your GTK theme's icons.  This looks a lot better than the default because it makes SciTE more like a native application.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h3>How much disk space is free? - submitted by phayz</h3>
        <p>Like all operating systems, Linux needs disk space to work.  Therefore it's a good idea to regularly check how much disk space is free on all partitions.  The simplest way to do this is with the command "df -h" in a console.  This will list each filesystem and the amount of free disk space on it.  The "-h" switch tells the DF command to display the disk space figures in human-readable format, not in bytes.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h3>artwiz fonts</h3>
        <p>The artwiz fonts is a small collection of bitmap fonts.  I'm not sure if they're still actively being developed but there hasn't been much activity at their home page for a long time.  Most of them are quite small but their clarity is excellent.  Personally I use the "snap" font everywhere on my desktop except for window titles.  It's very easy to read even though it's only about 8 point in size.  I use it because it makes most dialog boxes and menus smaller than they would be if I used a font such as DejaVu Sans.  I run X at a resolution of 1280x1024 on a 17 inch LCD monitor and I can read the text easily.  For those running higher resolutions and/or larger monitors, it might be too small to read.  Anyway, please try them and you might find that they suit you perfectly.</p>

<a name="packages"><h2>Focus On Package(s)</h2></a>

    <h3>SLIM</h3>
        <p><a href="http://slim.berlios.de/">SLIM</a> is a login manager and its name is formed from the words "Simple Login Manager".  It's described as "simple" because it's not dependent upon any desktop environment and so is light on resource usage.  It's very much like GDM or KDM in terms of functionality.  At the login screen you can select with the [F1] key which desktop environment or window manager to start.  SLIM comes with some basic themes but you can make your own if you don't like any of those.  It's perhaps best suited to those who are running a window manager because GDM and KDM offer more options.  If you choose to try SLIM, you'll need to edit /etc/sysconfig/desktop and uncomment the line containing "slim" and comment all other lines.  When you next reboot, SLIM will appear immediately after boot.</p>
