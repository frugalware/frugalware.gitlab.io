  <p>Here's a selection of recent events and other items that you might find
  interesting:</p>

  <h3>Frugalware 1.3pre2 released</h3>

  <p>On 28 June 2010, VMiklos announced the latest release in the Frugalware
  1.3 series - 1.3pre2. These releases are intended to allow users to test the
  release on their own hardware, to confirm if there are any bugs. This
  pre-release features changes which touch are very large number of packages,
  so testing is especially important now. If you have the available time and
  bandwidth, <em>please</em> download and test it.</p>

  <h3>Frugalware 1.3 release party planning is in progress</h3>

  <p>According to the current schedule, Frugalware release 1.3 - code-name
  "Haven" - is due to be released on 23 August 2010. Since it's only a few
  weeks away, it's now time to finalise planning for the release party, where
  everyone in the Frugalware community can celebrate their achievements. The
  release party for Frugalware 1.2 was conducted online via IRC but this time
  the plan is to have a real-life party. beecarl, contributor of Danish
  translations, has offered his home and garden as the party venue. He will
  even be providing food, consisting of honey sandwiches, honey cakes, honey
  biscuits and honeycomb. Drinks will also be provided, with coffee and tea
  both being sweetened with honey. Thanks to beecarl for his hospitality.
  Further details will be announced in the newsletter closer to the release
  date. As beecarl says, <strong>"Bee there, or bee square!"</strong></p>

  <h3>Online training - packaging applications for Frugalware</h3>

  <p>Frugalware developer Devil505 has recently conducted two online training
  sessions on the topic of packaging applications for Frugalware. They have
  been advertised on his <a href=
  "http://frugalware.org/~devil505/blog">blog</a> and the number of people
  taking part has been very good so far. Packaging an application is not easily
  explained in documentation, so being able to talk person to person makes it
  much easier for everyone - trainer and trainee.</p>

  <p>All classes are currently conducted in French, since this is the language
  Devil505 is most confident in using. There are no plans to offer classes in
  other languages, but hopefully this will come in time. If you would like to
  attend a training session, subscribe to the RSS feed of Devil505's blog and
  look out for announcements.</p>

  <h3>New Australian mirror</h3>

  <p>Frugalware now has a new mirror to replace the old one which, for reasons
  unknown, was not kept current. The new mirror is hosted by AARNet, an
  Australian company that operates Australia's Academic and Research Network
  (AARNet). It was involved in the very earliest days of the Internet in
  Australia. Because the new mirror has replaced the old one, the hostname
  ftp13.frugalware.org has been changed to refer to the new host, so
  pacman-g2's list of mirrors doesn't need to be updated.</p>

  <h3>Almost 100 newsletter issues!</h3>

  <p>In a major achievement, we are very near having released 100 newsletter
  issues. With an average of 1 newsletter issue every 3 weeks, it will be only
  11 months until issue 100 is released so please mark the date on your
  calendar. <strong>Disclaimer:</strong>Newsletter issue release dates may be
  subject to change, with the weather, global financial situation and the
  author's mood all being contributing factors. Frugalware takes no
  responsibility for any such delays to your excitement when reading the next
  issue(s).</p>

  <h3>Frugalware exam #2</h3>

  <p>In newsletter issue 47 all readers were given a test of their Frugalware
  knowledge. It's time for another test, so a new set of questions has been
  prepared. Answer the questions below as best you can, without referring to
  the Frugalware web site or any other online resource.</p>

  <p>The correct answers will be available in the next newsletter issue, with
  which you will be able to calculate your score. For the first time, prizes
  will be awarded to the those with the three highest scores. The prize for
  first place is an evening with phayz, listening to him describe the process
  by which each newsletter issue is written. Second prize will be two evenings
  with phayz and third prize three evenings. Good luck!</p>

  <p><b>Disclaimer</b> - Be aware that the hints &amp; tips provided here have
  NOT been tested and so come with no warranty.</p>

  <h3>Can't find your way home?</h3>

  <p>Sometimes it can be difficult to find the home page of a particular
  application. Frugalware maintains a record of the source of each package, and
  this is usually a sub-page of the home page. So if an Internet search doesn't
  help, search for the package on the Frugalware web site and you'll find the
  link in most cases.</p>

  <p>This section relies on your contributions! If you have some tips and
  tricks that you would like to be shown in the newsletter, <em>please</em>
  post them on the forums.</p>

  <h2><img src="http://frugalware.org/images/newsletter/package.png" align=
  "left">Focus On Package(s)</h2>

  <h3>ne - 'Nice Editor'</h3>

  <p>ne's official title is "Nice Editor" and as described on its web site,
  "...is easy to use for the beginner, but powerful and fully configurable for
  the wizard, and most sparing in its resource usage." In terms of 'look and
  feel', it's very much like nano. Its features include three user interfaces
  (control keystrokes, command line, and menus), configuration settings per
  file type, basic macro ability, syntax highlighting and the ability to load
  very large files. I like using ne at the command line instead of nano, mainly
  because ne's "hotkeys" are more familiar to me. Overall I think ne is a more
  capable editor than nano. Try it and see for yourself.</p>

  <h3>Heybuddy</h3>

  <p><a href="http://www.jezra.net/projects/heybuddy">Heybuddy</a> is a client
  for the identi.ca microblogging service which is provided by . It was written
  because its author wanted an identi.ca client for his Nokia N810 phone. Since
  it uses Python and the Python GTK bindings, it should be able to run on any
  platform for which these two are available. It's already proven to be very
  popular, with many people preferring it instead of Pino, although Pino is a
  client for the Twitter <strong>and</strong> identi.ca services. Heybuddy is
  still undergoing development, so get involved, whether it's helping to
  develop it or do testing. Just be aware that its author likes to keep things
  simple, so any added feature has to have a good reason to be accepted.</p>
