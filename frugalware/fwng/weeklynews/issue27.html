<a name="welcome"><h2>Welcome</h2></a>
    <p>The newsletter's aim is to keep you up to date with what's happened recently in the world of the Linux distribution 'Frugalware'.</p>

    <p>This issue of the newsletter features some changes.  I've added a table to the "Bugs" section which gives you an overview of activity in the BTS.  I've also reformatted into a table the list of security announcements.  If you look at the source of this newsletter you can easily tell that I'm not a web developer. :( I really need to improve the way in which I have formatted this information.  For the moment though, it works and that's all I'm worried about.</p>

<p>Features of this issue include:
  <ul>
    <li>Frugalware's developers are people too! - phayz</li>
    <li>Skype plugin for Bitlbee has been upgraded to verson 0.6.0</li>
    <li>ryuo's looking after older PCs</li>
    <li><b>Feature</b> - Help! Frugalware needs YOU!</li>
    <li>Focus On Package(s) - Mrxvt</li>
  </ul>
</p>

<a name="events"><h2>Events</h2></a>
<p>
    Here's a selection of events which have occurred since the previous newsletter:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <h3>Skype plugin for Bitlbee has been upgraded to verson 0.6.0</h3>
        <p>The Skype plugin for Bitlbee - and its package - has recently been upgraded.  Of course many packages have been recently upgraded but this one is special - it was developed by VMiklos, founder of Frugalware.  This version contains changes which had to be made to match API changes in Bitlbee itself.  For those that don't know, Bitlbee allows any IRC client to connect to other Instant Messenger networks, allowing for multi-protocol chat sessions.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h3>Frugalware's security is constantly being improved</h3>
        <p>Thanks to those Frugalware developers who deal with vulnerabilities in software packaged with Frugalware, our system's security is constantly being improved.  These people are notified of security vulnerabilities, patch the affected software and release updated packages.  You can easily identify packages which have been re-released for the latest version of Frugalware.  These packages contain the release's code name - at the moment it's "Kalgan".</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h3>ryuo's looking after old PCs</h3>
        <p>ryuo has recently been busy packaging various software, including some which is particularly suited to "older" PCs.  In the last newsletter I mentioned the ROX desktop environment.  In addition to these he's been packaging or updating the following software in the current repository:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>IceWM - a window manager which is light on system resources</li>
                <li>tint - a basic taskbar</li>
                <li>stalonetray - a window manager-independent system tray</li>
                <li>termit - a basic, tabbed terminal emulator</li>
            </ul>
    </li>
</ul>

<a name="interview"></a>
    <h2>Frugalware's developers are people too!</h2>
        <p>In this feature of the newsletter, Frugalware's developers reveal a little about themselves.  The aim is to show that "Frugalware's developers are people too!"  I thank the developers for taking the time to answer the questions.  There will be one interview per newsletter (until we run out of developers).</p>

    <h3>phayz</h3>
        <p>This issue's interview is with phayz, who is the author and editor of the Frugalware newsletter.  Please stand and hum the Australian national anthem - with a beer in one hand - while you read his interview.</p>

<dl>
    <dt><b>What's your name?</b></dt>
        <dd><p>Russell Dickenson</p></dd>
    <dt><b>What's your IRC nickname?</b></dt>
        <dd><p>phayz.  There's no meaning behind my nickname, it was the first name that I thought of.</p></dd>
    <dt><b>In what country do you live?</b></dt>
        <dd><p>Australia</p></dd>
    <dt><b>In what country were you born?</b></dt>
        <dd><p>Australia</p></dd>
    <dt><b>What do you like the most about where you live?</b></dt>
        <dd><p>Locally I like the area that I live in because all that my family and I need is very close.  In terms of the country I live in, I like the quite relaxed way in which people live their lives, also the natural beauty of the country.</p></dd>
    <dt><b>What do you do for the Frugalware project?</b></dt>
        <dd><p>I first need to point out that I'm a contributor to Frugalware, not technically a developer.  Anyway, I'm the author and editor of the Frugalware newsletter.  I started doing this after AlexExtreme, who did it before, decided to leave the project.  I have also done some minor editing work on Frugalware's documentation.  I hope to do more of this in the future but at the moment, simply don't have the spare time.</p></dd>
    <dt><b>What motivates you to work on Frugalware?</b></dt>
        <dd><p>I really like the distribution itself because it seems to "fit my brain" well.  :)  The community is also very positive and friendly.  I hope that my contribution somehow helps the overall project.</p></dd>
    <dt><b>What do you do when you're not working on Frugalware?</b></dt>
        <dd><p>I work as a Windows system administrator in a government department.  When I'm not at work I enjoy spending time with my young family (which also involves a lot of work).  When I'm not doing any of those things I'm listening to Linux-related podcasts or reading detective or adventure fiction.</p></dd>
    <dt><b>What's the view from your front door?</b></dt>
        <dd><p>Because my house is at the end of the street, the view from my front door looks down the street.  Anyway, why not open the door and <a href="http://frugalware.org/images/interviews/phayz.jpg">have a look</a>.</p></dd>

<a name="feature"><h2>Help! Frugalware needs YOU!</h2></a>

    <p>Yes - Frugalware needs your help.  Regardless of your technical skill or area of interest, there are many ways to help the project, including:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>producing artwork</li>
        <li>translating documentation, the web site, also Frugalware-specific applications - installer, pacman-g2, gfpm</li>
        <li>assisting others in the forums or in the IRC channels</li>
        <li>reporting any bugs you find, whether in normal use or testing.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>In the English-language forum, BobW recently said "Installing Frugalware on many PCs is my only contribution."  That's a <b>great</b> contribution.  Testing Frugalware on many PCs means there's a better chance of finding bugs affecting different hardware combinations.</p>
    <p>My own and only contribution is writing and editing this, the Frugalware newsletter.  I took over this role from AlexExtreme because I had enjoyed reading his newsletters and I wanted it to continue.  It doesn't take much of my time, although other things sometimes have to take priority.  I've had some positive feedback from several people, which I really appreciate.  While I'm currently the only author and editor of the newsletter, I don't want it to always be that way.  Contributions from others are always welcome and I'd be happy to share the work with others.</p>
        <p>If there's some part of Frugalware that you'd like to change or add to, tell everyone about it via the mailing list(s) or Bug Tracking system.  The developers must approve any changes and additions but, believe me, they're a very friendly and welcoming group.</p>

    <h2>Tips and tricks</h2>
    <b>Disclaimer</b> - Be aware that the hints &amp; tips provided here have NOT been tested and so come with no warranty.
<ul>
    <li>
        <h3>Keep your pacman(-g2) cache tidy - submitted by 'phayz'</h3>
        <p>Every package downloaded by pacman-g2 is contained in a directory called the cache (/var/cache/pacman-g2/pkg by default).  As time goes by, this cache directory can get quite large.  It's a good idea to regularly check the size of this directory.  If you want to tidy it up, the first step should be to have pacman-g2 remove from its cache those packages' files which have been replaced by newer versions.  You do this with the following command as the root user:</p>

        <pre>pacman-g2 -Sc</pre>

        <p>To delete ALL packages contained in the cache directory, enter the following command as the root user:</p>

        <pre>pacman-g2 -Scc</pre>
   </li>
</ul>

<a name="packages"</a>
<h2>Focus On Package(s)</h2>

    <h3>Mrxvt</h3>
    <p>"Mrxvt (previously named materm) is a lightweight, powerful multi-tabbed terminal emulator for the X window system. mrxvt is based on rxvt version 2.7.11 CVS and aterm. It implements many useful features seen in some modern X terminal emulators (like gnome-terminal and konsole) but aims to be fast, lightweight and independent of standard toolkits or desktop environments (e.g. Gnome / KDE).</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Multi-tab support</li>
        <li>Run time changeable per-tab titles / backgrounds / colors</li>
        <li>Session support for each tab</li>
        <li>Input broadcasting to all tabs</li>
        <li>Customizable keyboard shortcuts</li>
        <li>Translucency and pseudo transparency support</li>
        <li>JPEG / PNG / XPM background support</li>
        <li>Off-focus background fading</li>
        <li>Xft support</li>
        <li>Text shadow</li>
        <li>Menubar / popup menus</li>
        <li>XIM and multi-language (Chinese/Japanese/Korean) support</li>
        <li>Five different scroll bar styles</li>
        <li>Small and fast</li>
        <li>Does not depend on GTK / Qt / Gnome / KDE.</li>
        <li>Available on multiple platforms</li>
        <li>utmp/wtmp/lastlog logging"</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Especially interesting is its concept of profiles.  An Mrxvt profile is a pre-defined group of settings.  Each profile can be launched from either within Mrxvt or the command line, allowing them to be launched on startup.  Since Mrxvt is a tabbed terminal emulator, each profile appears as a tab.  One example use would be to have on launching Mrxvt, one tab being a "plain" terminal, another running the mc file manager and yet another running weechat (an IRC client).</p>

<p>Like similar terminal emulators - urxvt, rxvt, aterm etc - it's very configurable.  Just about every aspect of its operation is configurable, resulting in a long man page. :)  All these features come in a very small package, with just 0.64 MB of disk space used when it's installed.</p>

<h2>Security announcements</h2>
    <p><b>Remember</b> - According to the normal support arrangements for Frugalware, the release of 0.8 ("Kalgan") means that support for the previous release has ended.  This means that no further security or bug fixes will be released for Frugalware 0.7 ("Sayshell").</p>
