<h2>Events</h2>
<p>
    Here's a selection of events which have occurred since the previous newsletter:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
    <h3>Kalgan - are we there yet?</h3>
        <p>On 10 January 2008, vmiklos <a href="http://www.frugalware.org/news/83">announced</a> that Frugalware 0.8 ("Kalgan") pre-release 2 had been released.  This release has some new features, also some updated packages, including XFCE 4.4.2 and OpenOffice 2.3.1.</p>
        <p>The purpose of Frugalware's pre-releases and release candidates is to allow anyone who's interested to test the work in progress.  If you have the bandwidth and time required to help, please test these pre-releases and release candidates.  The more bugs that are found during the testing phase, the better the quality of the final release.</p>
        <p>According to my calculations, there are only 937,363,242,343,242,522 trillion light years to go.  :)</p>
    </li>
    <li>
    <h3>Xorg 7.3 - available for testing</h3>
        <p>Xorg 7.3 is now available for testing to all those who are willing and able.  This release include Xorg server version 1.4 and includes some new features as well as updated drivers and bug fixes.

    <h2>Tips and tricks</h2>
    <b>Disclaimer</b> - Be aware that the hints &amp; tips provided here have NOT been tested and so come with no warranty.
<ul>
    <li>
        <h3>Mirrors, mirrors, speed is the key! - submitted by 'phayz'</h3>
        <p>When downloading a package, pacman will try to retrieve the package from each of the Frugalware mirrors in turn until it succeeds or gets to the end of the mirror list.</p>

        <p>To have packages downloaded faster, re-sort the list of Frugalware's mirrors so that at least the three mirrors with the lowest ping response times are at the top. Now when pacman tries to download a package, it will first try the fastest mirror(s) first.</p>

        <p>Frugalware's mirrors are listed in either - <pre>/etc/pacman-g2/repos/frugalware</pre>for -stable, or <pre>/etc/pacman-g2/repos/frugalware-current</pre>for -current

        <h3>Installing TrueType fonts - submitted by 'bee-carl'</h3>
        <p>If you have found some TrueType fonts on the Internet you would like being able to use in all your programs on your computer, here are the instructions -</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Save the font in your Home directory, e.g. /home/carl/fonts</li>
            <li>Open now a root terminal and cd /to/where/the/fonts/are/saved.</li>
            <li>After this the font is to be copied to /usr/lib/X11/fonts/TTF</li>
            <li>cp name-font.ttf /usr/lib/X11/fonts/TTF</li>
            <li>And now as root you need to run fc-cache before you will be able to use the font in any programs you have on the computer.</li>
            <li>After this you restart X, and now you can use your new TTF font in all programs.</li>
        </ol>
    </li>
</ul>
    <p>This section relies on your contributions! If you have some tips and tricks that you would like to be shown in the newsletter, <b><u><i>please</i></u></b> post them on the forums in the Tips and Tricks section!</p>

<h2>Focus On Package(s)</h2>

    <p>In a new section of the newsletter, I focus on one or more packages and give a general overview of their features.</p>
    <h3>VirtualBox</h3>
        <p><a href="http://www.virtualbox.org">VirtualBox</a> is an x86 virtualisation product supporting Windows, Linux and Macintosh hosts and an even wider range of guest operating systems.  It is developed by <b>innotek</b>, and is available in two editions - one being GPL-d, Open Source and the other is for only Private use and evaluation.  The Open Source edition lacks some features of the other edition but most will be able to live without them.  Features added recently to both editions include native support for VMware disk images and seamless windows.  VirtualBox is ideal for many people but particularly those who want to use a free virtualisation product ('free' as in beer and 'free' as in freedom) with a feature set which compares with its proprietary competitors.</p>
        <p>VirtualBox is useful in all sorts of situations, for example -</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Testing a new release of Frugalware</li>
            <li>Running applications under another operating system without having to reboot</li>
            <li>Documenting - with screenshots - the boot sequence/messages</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Go ahead and try it - you just might be surprised at what comes in so small a package.</p>

<h2>Security announcements</h2>
<p>
    According to the normal support arrangements for Frugalware, when Frugalware 0.7 (Sayshell) was released, support for the previous release ended.  This means that no further security or bug fixes will be released for Frugalware 0.6 (Terminus).
