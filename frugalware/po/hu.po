msgstr ""

#: ../about.php:40
msgid ""
"We have a <i>current</i> and a <i>stable</i> branch. The <i>current</i> "
"branch is updated daily, and we update our <i>stable</i> branch around every "
"6 months."

msgid "What is &quot;The Frugalware Philosophy&quot; about?"
msgstr ""

#: ../about.php:42
msgid ""
"Briefly: simplicity, multimedia, design. We try to make Frugalware as simple "
"as possible while not forgetting to keep it comfortable. We try to ship "
"fresh and stable software, as close to the original source as possible, "
"because in our opinion most software is the best as is, and doesn't need "
"patching."
msgstr ""

#: ../about.php:43
msgid "What is the license of Frugalware?"
msgstr ""

#: ../about.php:44
msgid ""
"That's two questions. Most software included in Frugalware have a GPL or BSD "
"compatible license, for more information about a license of a specific "
"package, refer to the LICENSE or COPYRIGHT file in the source tarball of the "
"package. On the other hand, the part written by our team (FrugalBuild "
"scripts, setup, homepage, etc) is released under GPL license. To make it "
"even more complicated, some parts of the setup and init scripts are written "
"by Patrick J. Volkerding. We GPL our additions, but Patrick J. Volkerding's "
"code is still under the BSD license. For more information, refer to the "
"COPYRIGHT file in the root directory of the FST (Frugalware Source Tree)."

msgid "What package manager does Frugalware use?"
msgstr ""

#: ../about.php:46
msgid ""
"We don't have our own package manager, we use Judd Vinet's great work, the "
"<a href=\"http://www.archlinux.org/pacman\">pacman</a> package manager. It's "
"a tar.bz2 based package manager, similar to Slackware's .tgz. Our packages' "
"extension is .fpm to differentiate them from regular tarballs. Unlike "
"Slackware's scripts, pacman is written in C, so it's much faster."
msgstr ""

#: ../about.php:47
msgid "How does Frugalware manage updating obsolete packages?"
msgstr ""

#: ../about.php:48
msgid ""
"We don't have any standalone program for updating packages as pacman manages "
"this task too. To update your package database, use <tt>pacman&nbsp;-Sy</"
"tt>, and to update your packages according the just synchronized package "
"database, you use <tt>pacman&nbsp;-Su</tt>. To install a package with the "
"necessary dependencies directly from a mirror ftp server, you issue "
"<tt>pacman&nbsp;-S&nbsp;foo</tt>. For more information, refer to the pacman "
"man page."

msgid ""
"Currently we have three mailing lists, an irc channel and forums that can be "
"used to communicate with us or other users and to get help. The irc channel "
"is on the Freenode network (server: irc.freenode.net). For more information "

msgid "For whom is Frugalware recommended to use?"
msgstr ""

#: ../about.php:54
msgid ""
"Frugalware is designed for intermediate users. Installing Frugalware is not "
"a magic, of course, but you should know what a partition, an MBR (Master "
"Boot Record), etc. is."

#: ../about.php:56
msgid ""
"Get involved! :) If you installed Frugalware from CDs, get the full FST via "
"repoman, which is available in pacman-tools. The sources are included in the "
"DVD edition. Then start to play with the FrugalBuild scripts, for a typical "
"example, refer to the <a href=\"packages.php?pkgname=cabextract"
"\">cabextract</a> package. Try to improve them, or write a new one for a "
"currently unsupported program. Then send your patches to the <a href="
"\"mailman/listinfo/frugalware-devel\">devel</a> mailing list. From this "
"point everything will come naturally to you :)"

msgid "What do developers do?"
msgstr ""

#: ../about.php:58
msgid ""
"In short, what they want to, if they play a square game. They may maintain "
"packages: building them if a newer version is available and update the "
"FrugalBuild scripts to work correctly against a newer version. They can "
"contribute a new build script to a previously non-existent package. They can "
"write articles about Frugalware, or anything else in connection with the "
"Frugalware community. If you only want to help us, but you don't want to "
"hack, you may help in translating Frugalware to your or other language. And, "
"of course, we happily accept <a href=\"donations.php\">donations</a> :)"

"Currently we support x86 and x86_64 platforms, and inside x86, only i686 "

"If there are any claims, an i386 port will be created, but currently we "
"don't have resources to build and maintain those packages. Outside x86, "
"currently we don't have any non-x86 hardware, but happily accept such "
