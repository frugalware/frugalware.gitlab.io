2) A NULL pointer dereference error within the Infiniband dissector can be exploited to cause a crash.
3) An error within the ERF file parser can be exploited to cause a heap-based buffer overflow.
Successful exploitation of this vulnerability may allow execution of arbitrary code.</desc>

		<desc>Some vulnerabilities have been reported in Django, which can be exploited by malicious people to disclose certain system information, manipulate certain data, conduct cache poisoning attacks, and cause a DoS (Denial of Service).
1) An error within the handling of sessions within django.contrib.sessions when using the caching backend can be exploited to manipulate session information.
Successful exploitation requires that the session key is known and the application allows attackers to store dictionary-like objects with a valid session key in the cache.
2) An error when verifying if URLs provided to the "URLField" field type correctly resolve can be exploited to exhaust all of the server's processes and memory by providing an URL to a malicious server.
3) An error within the handling of redirect responses when verifying URLs provided to the "URLField" field type can be exploited to e.g. determine the existence of local files on the server by returning a redirect response to a "file://" URL.
4) An error within the handling of the "X-Forwarded-Host" HTTP header when e.g. generating full URLs for redirect responses can be exploited to conduct cache poisoning attacks.</desc>

		<desc>Some vulnerabilities have been reported in MantisBT, which can be exploited by malicious people to conduct cross-site scripting attacks and disclose potentially sensitive information and by malicious users to compromise a vulnerable system.

1) Certain input passed via the URL is not properly sanitised before being returned to the user. This can be exploited to execute arbitrary HTML and script code in a user's browser session in context of an affected site.

2) Input passed to the "action" parameter in bug_actiongroup_ext_page.php and bug_actiongroup_page.php is not properly verified before being used to include files. This can be exploited to include arbitrary files from local resources via directory traversal attacks and URL-encoded NULL bytes.

Note: In combination with MantisBT's file upload functionality, this can be exploited to execute arbitrary PHP code.

3) Input passed to the "os", "os_build", and "platform" parameters in bug_report_page.php and bug_update_advanced_page.php is not properly sanitised before being returned to the user. This can be exploited to execute arbitrary HTML and script code in a users browser session in context of an affected site.</desc>

			The vulnerability is caused due to an error in KDC within the "process_tgs_req()" function in kdc/do_tgs_req.c when validating or renewing tickets and can be exploited to trigger a double-free condition.
			Successful exploitation may allow execution of arbitrary code.
			3) A vulnerability has been reported in Kerberos, which can be exploited by malicious users to cause a DoS (Denial of Service).
			The vulnerability is caused due to a NULL pointer dereference error when processing certain Kerberos AP-REQ authenticators, which can be exploited to cause a crash in e.g. kadmind or other applications linked against the GSS-API library by sending an AP-REQ authenticator with a missing checksum field.</desc>
