		<desc>1) A vulnerability has been reported in Kerberos, which can be exploited by malicious people to cause a DoS (Denial of Service).
			The vulnerability is caused due to an assertion error within the "spnego_gss_accept_sec_context()" function in src/lib/gssapi/spnego/spnego_mech.c when receiving an invalid packet, which can be exploited to e.g. crash an application using the library by sending a specially crafted packet.
			2) Joel Johnson has reported a vulnerability in Kerberos, which can be exploited by malicious users to potentially compromise a vulnerable system.
			The vulnerability is caused due to an error in KDC within the "process_tgs_req()" function in kdc/do_tgs_req.c when validating or renewing tickets and can be exploited to trigger a double-free condition.
			Successful exploitation may allow execution of arbitrary code.
			3) A vulnerability has been reported in Kerberos, which can be exploited by malicious users to cause a DoS (Denial of Service).
			The vulnerability is caused due to a NULL pointer dereference error when processing certain Kerberos AP-REQ authenticators, which can be exploited to cause a crash in e.g. kadmind or other applications linked against the GSS-API library by sending an AP-REQ authenticator with a missing checksum field.</desc>

		<desc>Some vulnerabilities have been reported in Xpdf, which can be exploited by malicious people to potentially compromise a user's system.
1) Multiple integer overflows in "SplashBitmap::SplashBitmap()" can be exploited to cause heap-based buffer overflows.
2) An integer overflow error in "ObjectStream::ObjectStream()" can be exploited to cause a heap-based buffer overflow.
3) Multiple integer overflows in "Splash::drawImage()" can be exploited to cause heap-based buffer overflows.
4) An integer overflow error in "PSOutputDev::doImageL1Sep()" can be exploited to cause a heap-based buffer overflow when converting a PDF document to a PS file.
Successful exploitation of the vulnerabilities may allow execution of arbitrary code by tricking a user into opening a specially crafted PDF file.</desc>
