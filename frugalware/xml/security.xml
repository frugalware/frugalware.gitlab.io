		<desc>Some vulnerabilities have been reported in lighttpd, which can be exploited by malicious users and malicious people to cause a DoS (Denial of Service).
			1) An error exists during the parsing of the "\r\n\r\n" sequence. This can be exploited to cause an infinite loop by aborting the connection while the server parses the sequence, which e.g. results in a high CPU load and exhaustion of system resources .
			2) An NULL pointer dereference exists within the mtime handling of files. This can be exploited to cause a crash by requesting a file with mtime 0. Successful exploitation requires that the attacker can request or upload files with mtime 0, or can otherwise modify the mtime of files.</desc>

		<desc>Andreas Nolden has reported a vulnerability in Qt, which potentially can be exploited to conduct cross-site scripting attacks in applications using the Qt libraries. The vulnerability is caused due to Qt not properly rejecting overly long UTF-8 character sequences. This can be exploited to bypass certain character sanitation mechanisms and allow e.g. the execution of HTML and script code in applications depending on the correct behavior.</desc>

		<desc>Some vulnerabilities have been reported in MadWifi, which can be exploited by malicious people to gain knowledge of potentially sensitive information or cause a DoS (Denial of Service).
			1) An error within the "ieee80211_input()" function when handling AUTH frames from IBSS nodes can be exploited to cause a kernel crash by sending specially crafted AUTH frames. Successful exploitation may require that the "Ad-Hoc" mode is used.
			2) MadWifi does not correctly handle Channel Switch Announcements. This can be exploited to force a channel switch thus interrupting the communication by injecting a Channel Switch Announcement with "CS Count" set to 1 or less.
			3) An error within ieee80211_output.c may cause unencrypted packets to be sent before the WPA authentication is completed. This can be exploited to gain knowledge of certain sensitive information, which may be leveraged for further attacks.</desc>

The vulnerability is caused due to a regular expression in "RegistryCooker.pm" (mod_perl 2.x) or "PerlRun.pm" (mod_perl 1.x) that uses the "path_info" variable without properly escaping it. This can be exploited to cause a DoS by sending requests with specially crafted URLs to a vulnerable server.</desc>

		<desc>A vulnerability has been reported in Asterisk, which can be exploited by malicious people to cause a DoS (Denial of Service). The vulnerability is caused due to an error within the handling of certain SIP INVITE messages. This can be exploited to crash the server by sending a SIP INVITE message with 2 SDP headers, where the second header contains an invalid IP address. Successful exploitation requires that the callee is an invalid dailplan or user.
			qwerty1979 has reported a vulnerability in Asterisk, which can be exploited by malicious people to cause a DoS (Denial of Service). The vulnerability is caused due to an error in the processing of SIP replies from a remote system and can be exploited to crash the service via the remote system sending a SIP reply containing SIP Response code 0.
			A security issue has been reported in Asterisk, which can be exploited by malicious people to bypass certain security restrictions. The security issue is caused due to a problem within the AEL (Asterisk Extension Language) when generating switch extensions. Depending on the extension, an attacker may be able to guess and dial a special number, which could allow him to e.g. listen to the voicemails of other users.</desc>

This can be exploited to cause a stack-based (if the "alloca()" function is available) or heap-based memory corruption by passing specially crafted parameters to the function. Successful exploitation may allow the execution of arbitrary code with escalated privileges.

		<desc>Some vulnerabilities have been reported in MPlayer, which can potentially be exploited by malicious people to compromise a user's system.
			The vulnerabilities are caused due to boundary errors in the "DMO_VideoDecoder_Open()" function in loader/dmo/DMO_VideoDecoder.c and in the "DS_VideoDecoder_Open()" function in loader/dshow/DS_VideoDecoder.c. These can be exploited to cause heap-based buffer overflows and may allow execution of arbitrary code via a specially crafted media file.</desc>
