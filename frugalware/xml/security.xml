		<desc>Some vulnerabilities have been reported in FreeType, which potentially can be exploited by malicious people to compromise an application using the library.
			1) An integer overflow error exists in the processing of PFB font files. This can be exploited to cause a heap-based buffer overflow via a PFB file containing a specially crafted "Private" dictionary table.
			2) An error in the processing of PFB font files can be exploited to trigger the "free()" of memory areas that are not allocated on the heap.
			3) An off-by-one error exists in the processing of PFB font files. This can be exploited to cause a one-byte heap-based buffer overflow via a specially crafted PFB file.
			4) An off-by-one error exists in the implementation of the "SHC" instruction while processing TTF files. This can be exploited to cause a one-byte heap-based buffer overflow via a specially crafted TTF file.

		<desc>Some vulnerabilities have been reported in Python, where some have unknown impact and others can potentially be exploited by malicious people to cause a DoS (Denial of Service) or to compromise a vulnerable system.
			1) Various integer overflow errors exist in core modules e.g. stringobject, unicodeobject, bufferobject, longobject, tupleobject, stropmodule, gcmodule, mmapmodule.
			2) An integer overflow in the hashlib module can lead to an unreliable cryptographic digest results.
			3) Integer overflow errors in the processing of unicode strings can be exploited to cause buffer overflows on 32-bit systems.
			4) An integer overflow exists in the PyOS_vsnprintf() function on architectures that do not have a "vsnprintf()" function.
			5) An integer underflow error in the PyOS_vsnprintf() function when passing zero-length strings can lead to memory corruption.
			Successful exploitation of some of these vulnerabilities may allow to crash an application or to execute arbitrary code, but depends on the implementation of an Python application.</desc>

		<desc>Some vulnerabilities have been reported in Mozilla Firefox, which can be exploited by malicious people to conduct cross-site scripting and spoofing attacks, bypass certain security restrictions, disclose sensitive information, or potentially compromise a user's system.
			1) Multiple errors in the layout and JavaScript engines can be exploited to corrupt memory.
			2) An error in the handling of unprivileged XUL documents can be exploited to load Chrome scripts from a "fastload" file via "script" elements.
			3) An error in the "mozIJSSubScriptLoader.LoadScript()" function can be exploited to bypass XPCNativeWrappers and run arbitrary code with Chrome privileges.
			Successful exploitation requires that an add-on using the affected function is installed.
			4) An error in the block reflow process can be exploited to cause a crash or potentially execute arbitrary code.
			5) An error in the processing of file URLs contained within local directory listings can potentially be exploited to execute malicious JavaScript content.
			6) Multiple errors in the implementation of the JavaScript same origin policy can be exploited to execute arbitrary script code in the context of a different domain.
			7) Multiple errors in the verification of signed JAR files can be exploited to execute arbitrary JavaScript code with the privileges of the JAR's signer.
			8) An error in the implementation of file upload forms can be exploited to upload arbitrary local files to a remote webserver via specially crafted "DOM Range" and "originalTarget" elements.
			9) An error in the Java LiveConnect implementation on Mac OS X can be exploited to establish arbitrary socket connections.
			10) An uninitialized memory access in the processing of improperly encoded ".properties" files can potentially be exploited to disclose sensitive memory via an add-on using the malformed file.
			11) An error in the processing of "Alt Names" provided by "peer" trusted certificates can be exploited to conduct spoofing attacks.

		<desc>Sebastian Krahmer has reported some security issues in Postfix, which can be exploited by malicious, local users to disclose potentially sensitive information and perform certain actions with escalated privileges.
			1) A security issue is caused due to Postfix incorrectly handling symlink files. This can be exploited to e.g. append mail messages to arbitrary files by creating a hardlink to a symlink owned by the root user.
			Successful exploitation requires write permission to the mail spool directory, that there is no "root" mailbox, and users can create a hardlink to a symlink (e.g. Linux 2.x, Solaris, Irix 6.5).
			2) A security issue is caused due to Postfix not correctly checking the ownership of the destination when delivering email. This can be exploited to e.g. disclose emails by creating an insecure mailbox file for other users.
			Successful exploitation requires permission to create files within the mail spool directory.</desc>

			1) Input passed to an unspecified parameter is not properly sanitised before being returned to the user. This can be exploited to execute arbitrary HTML and script code in a user's browser session in context of an affected site.
			2) A vulnerability is caused by the fact that the private filesystem uses the MIME media type it receives from the web browser when handling uploads. This can be exploited for script insertion attacks.
			Successful exploitation of this vulnerability requires valid user credentials with the right to upload files.
			3) A vulnerability is caused due to missing restrictions on what file types that users are allowed to upload in the BlogAPI module. This can be exploited to e.g. execute arbitrary PHP code.
			Successful exploitation of this vulnerability requires valid user credentials with the "administer content with blog api" permission.
			4) A vulnerability is caused due to the application allowing users to perform certain actions via HTTP requests without performing any validity checks to verify the request. This can be exploited to add or delete user access rules, by enticing a logged-in user to visit a malicious web page.</desc>

			Successful exploitation allows to bypass the "safe_mode_exec_dir" and "disable_functions" directives, and potentially to inject arbitrary shell commands via user controlled input, but requires that the shell uses a locale with a variable width character (e.g. GBK, EUC-KR, SJIS).
			3) A vulnerability is caused due to an error during path translation in cgi_main.c. This can potentially be exploited to execute arbitrary code, but depends on how a targeted application is using PHP.
			4) An error in cURL can be exploited to bypass the "safe_mode" directive.
			5) A boundary error in PCRE can potentially be exploited by malicious people to cause a DoS or compromise a vulnerable system.</desc>

		<desc>Some vulnerabilities have been reported in Adobe Flash Player, which can be exploited by malicious people to bypass certain security restrictions, conduct cross-site scripting attacks, or to potentially compromise a user's system.
			1) A boundary error exists in the processing of "Declare Function (V7)" tags. This can be exploited to cause a heap-based buffer overflow via specially crafted flags.
			2) An integer overflow in the processing of multimedia files can be exploited to cause a buffer overflow.
			Successful exploitation of the vulnerabilities may allow execution of arbitrary code.
			3) Errors when pinning a hostname to an IP address can be exploited to conduct DNS rebinding attacks.
			4) An error when sending HTTP headers can be exploited to bypass cross-domain policy files.
			5) An error exists in the enforcing of cross-domain policy files. This can be exploited to bypass certain security restrictions on web servers hosting cross-domain policy files.
			6) Input passed to unspecified parameters when handling e.g. the "asfunction:" protocol is not properly sanitised before being returned to the user. This can be exploited to inject arbitrary HTML and script code in a user's browser session in context of an affected site.</desc>

		<desc>A weakness and a security issue have been reported in gnome-screensaver, which can be exploited by malicious people with physical access to disclose potentially sensitive information or bypass certain security restrictions.
			1) A weakness is caused due to the "Leave message" feature allowing attackers to e.g. paste the contents of the clipboard of the user who's screen is currently locked, which can be exploited to disclose potentially sensitive information.
			2) A security issue is caused due to an error if the NIS authentication method is used. This can be exploited to bypass the authentication check and unlock the screen if the NIS server is not reachable.</desc>

			The vulnerability is caused due to the application using predictable standard C library functions to generate random numbers (e.g. "rand()" and "srand()"), which are then used to create the transaction ID (TRXID) and UDP source port. This can be exploited to poison the DNS cache by guessing the transaction TRXID and the UDP source port.</desc>

		<desc>Some vulnerabilities and weaknesses have been reported in Mozilla Firefox, which can be exploited by malicious people to bypass certain security restrictions, disclose potentially sensitive information, conduct cross-site scripting and phishing attacks, and potentially compromise a user's system.
			1) An unspecified error in the handling of "XPCNativeWrappers" can lead to the execution of arbitrary Javascript code with the user's privileges via "setTimeout()" calls.
			2) Various errors in the handling of Javascript code can be exploited to conduct cross-site scripting attacks or execute arbitrary code.
			3) Various errors in the layout engine can be exploited to cause a memory corruption.
			4) Various errors in the Javascript engine can be exploited to cause a memory corruption.
			Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities may allow execution of arbitrary code.
			5) An error within the handling of HTTP "Referer:" headers sent with requests to URLs containing "Basic Authentication" credentials having an empty username can be exploited to bypass cross-site request forgery protections.
			6) The problem is that Firefox offers a previously configured private SSL certificate when establishing connections to webservers requesting SSL Client Authentication. This can potentially be exploited to disclose sensitive information via a malicious webserver.
			7) An error in the handling of the "jar:" protocol can be exploited to establish connections to arbitrary ports on the local machine.
			8) An error when displaying XUL pop-up windows can be exploited to hide the window's borders and facilitate phishing attacks.</desc>

		<desc>Some vulnerabilities have been reported in Sun Java, which can be exploited by malicious people to cause a DoS (Denial of Service), to bypass certain security restrictions, or to compromise a vulnerable system.
			1) Two unspecified errors in the Java Runtime Environment Virtual Machine can be exploited by a malicious, untrusted applet to read and write local files and execute local applications.
			2) An unspecified error in the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) when processing XSLT transformations can be exploited by untrusted applets or applications to e.g. read certain URL resources or potentially execute arbitrary code.
			3) A boundary error exists in the "useEncodingDecl()" function when parsing the xml header character encoding attribute. This can be exploited to cause a stack-based buffer overflow and execute arbitrary code via a specially crafted JNLP file containing an overly long charset name in the xml header.
			4) A boundary error exists in the "useEncodingDecl()" function when processing xml-based JNLP files for UTF8 characters. This can be exploited to cause a stack-based buffer overflow and execute arbitrary code via a specially crafted JNLP file containing overly long key name in the xml header.
			5) A boundary error exist in Java Web Start, which can be exploited e.g. by an untrusted Java Web Start application to read and write local files and execute local applications.
			6) An unspecified error in Java Web Start can be exploited by a malicious, untrusted applet to read and write local files or execute local applications.
			7) An unspecified error in Java Web Start can be exploited by an untrusted Java Web Start application to create files on the system and run local applications with the privileges of the user running the untrusted Java Web Start application.
			8) An unspecified error in the Java Plug-in can be exploited by an applet to bypass the same origin policy and to execute local applications.
			9) Some errors in the Java Runtime Environment image parsing library within the processing of ICC profiles can be exploited to crash the JVM or to write local files and execute local applications.
			10) An error in the Java Runtime Environment may allow java script code within a browser to make connections through Java APIs to network services on the local system.
			11) A boundary error exists in Java Web Start in the processing of JNLP files, which can be exploited to cause a stack-based buffer overflow when a user visits a malicious web site.</desc>

		<desc>Secunia Research has discovered a vulnerability in xine-lib, which can be exploited by malicious people to compromise a user's system.
			The vulnerability is caused due to a boundary error within the "sdpplin_parse()" function in input/libreal/sdpplin.c. This can be exploited to overwrite arbitrary memory regions via an overly large "streamid" SDP parameter included in a malicious RTSP stream.
			Successful exploitation allows execution of arbitrary code.</desc>

		<desc>Some vulnerabilities have been reported in teTeX, which can be exploited by malicious, local users to disclose and manipulate sensitive information and by malicious people to potentially compromise a vulnerable system.
			1) A boundary error in dvips can be exploited to cause a stack-based buffer overflow when a user is tricked into opening a specially crafted DVI file containing an overly long hypertext reference.
			Successful exploitation requires that dvips is invoked with the "-z" option.
			2) Some boundary errors in dviljk can be exploited to cause buffer overflows when a user is enticed to print a specially crafted DVI file.
			Successful exploitation of vulnerabilities #1 and #2 may allow execution of arbitrary code.
			3) An error due to dvips using the insecure "tmpnam()" function when converting DVI files can potentially be exploited to disclose and modify sensitive information.</desc>

		<desc>A vulnerability has been reported in UnZip, which potentially can be exploited by malicious people to compromise a user's system.
			The vulnerability is caused due to the use of uninitialized pointers in the "inflate_dynamic()" function in inflate.c. This can potentially be exploited to free an attacker-controlled memory region and execute arbitrary code via a specially crafted ZIP compressed file.
			Successful exploitation may allow execution of arbitrary code.</desc>

		<desc>Some vulnerabilities have been reported in Ruby on Rails, which can be exploited by malicious people to disclose sensitive information and conduct cross-site scripting attacks.
			1) Input passed to the "to_json" function is not properly sanitised before being returned to the user. This can be exploited to execute arbitrary HTML and script code in a user's browser session in context of an affected site.
			2) An error in ActiveResource when processing responses using the "Hash.from_xml" function can be exploited to determine the existence of files and to read the contents of arbitrary XML files.
			3) A security issue is caused due to lib/action_controller/cgi_process.rb removing the ":cookie_only" attribute from "DEFAULT_SESSION_OPTIONS" and can be exploited to conduct session fixation attacks against applications using the affected component.</desc>

		<desc>Some security issues have been reported in lighttpd, which can be exploited by malicious people to disclose potentially sensitive information.
			1) A security issue is caused due to an error in mod_cgi, which can lead to the disclosure of source code when lighttpd is unable to fork.
			2) A security issue is caused due to the mod_userdir module using "$HOME" by default if no userdir.path is set. This can be exploited to disclose the content of arbitrary files on certain systems via e.g. the "nobody" user.</desc>
