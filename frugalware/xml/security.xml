		<desc>Some vulnerabilities have been reported in udev, which can be exploited by malicious, local users to cause a DoS (Denial of Service) or gain escalated privileges.
			1) A vulnerability is caused due to udev not properly verifying the credentials of received NETLINK messages. This can be exploited to gain escalated privileges by sending multicast NETLINK messages.
			2) A vulnerability is caused due to a boundary error within the "util_path_encode()" function in udev/lib/libudev-util.c. This can be exploited to cause a crash by providing specially crafted input.</desc>

		<desc>Some vulnerabilities have been reported in Drupal, which can be exploited by malicious people to conduct script insertion attacks or to disclose potentially sensitive information.
			1) User provided input is not properly sanitised before being used. This can be exploited to insert arbitrary HTML and script code, which will be executed in a user's browser session in context of an affected site when the malicious data is viewed and interpreted as UTF-7.
			Successful exploitation requires the ability to post content.
			2) An unspecified error can be exploited to disclose information about form submissions when a user is tricked into submitting a form after following a specially crafted link to the site. This can further be exploited to conduct e.g. cross-site request forgery attacks.</desc>

		<desc>A vulnerability has been reported in Blender, which can be exploited by malicious, local users to gain escalated privileges.
			The vulnerability is caused due to Blender using the current working directory as part of the module search path, which can be exploited to e.g. execute arbitrary Python code with the privileges of another user by tricking the user into executing Blender in a directory containing a Python file named like one of the modules Blender uses.</desc>

		<desc>A vulnerability has been reported in phpMyAdmin, which can be exploited by malicious people to compromise a vulnerable system.
			The vulnerability is caused due to the setup script not properly sanitising configuration parameters. This can be exploited to inject arbitrary PHP code into the phpMyAdmin configuration file.
			This is related to vulnerability #2 in: FSA591
			NOTE: Successful exploitation requires that installation best-practices have not been followed and the setup scripts have not been deleted after a successful installation.</desc>

		<desc>Some vulnerabilities have been reported in phpMyAdmin, which can be exploited by malicious people to conduct cross-site scripting attacks or compromise a vulnerable system.
			1) Input passed via export page cookies is not properly sanitised before being returned to the user. This can be exploited to execute arbitrary HTML and script code in a user's browser session in the context of an affected site.
			2) The vulnerability is caused due to the application not properly sanitising configuration parameters during the setup procedure. This can be exploited to inject arbitrary PHP code into the phpMyAdmin configuration file.
			NOTE: Successful exploitation of this vulnerability requires that installation best-practices have not been followed and the setup scripts have not been deleted after a successful installation.</desc>

		<desc>Some vulnerabilities have been reported in Wireshark, which can potentially be exploited by malicious people to cause a DoS (Denial of Service) and compromise a user's system.
			1) A vulnerability is caused due to a format string error within the PN-DCP dissector when processing station names containing format string specifiers. This can be exploited to cause a crash and potentially execute arbitrary code via specially crafted packets captured off the wire or loaded via a capture file.
			2) An error within the Check Point High-Availability Protocol (CPHAP) dissector can be exploited to cause a crash.</desc>
