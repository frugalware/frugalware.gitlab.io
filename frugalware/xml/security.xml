		<desc>Clemens Kolbitsch and Sylvester Keil have reported a vulnerability in MadWifi, which can be exploited by malicious people to cause a DoS (Denial of Service).
			The vulnerability is caused due to an error in the processing of beacon frames. This can be exploited via a specially crafted beacon frame with an overly large "length" value (greater than 15) in the extended supported rates element ("xrates").
			Successful exploitation causes the driver to exit and results in a kernel panic.</desc>

		<desc>Omer Singer has reported two vulnerabilities in phpMyAdmin, which can be exploited by malicious people to conduct cross-site scripting attacks.
			1) Input passed via the URL is not properly sanitised before being returned to the user. This can be exploited to execute arbitrary HTML and script code in a user's browser session in context of an affected site. Successful exploitation requires that the user is running a browser that has not URL-encoded the request (e.g. Internet Explorer 6).
			2) Input passed in the URL to server_status.php is not properly sanitised before being returned to the user. This can be exploited to execute arbitrary HTML and script code in a user's browser session in context of an affected site. Successful exploitation requires that the target user has valid user credentials. NOTE: Some other potential cross-site scripting problems have also been fixed by the vendor.</desc>

		<desc>Andy Polyakov has reported a vulnerability in OpenSSL, which can be exploited by malicious people to cause a DoS (Denial of Service) and potentially compromise a vulnerable system.
			The vulnerability is caused due to an unspecified error within the DTLS implementation. Successful exploitation may allow the execution of arbitrary code.
			Note: Reportedly, this vulnerability affects only clients and servers explicitly using DTLS.</desc>

		<desc>A vulnerability has been discovered in PWLib, which can be exploited by malicious people to cause a DoS (Denial of Service).
			The vulnerability is caused due to an error within the "PString::vsprintf()" method in src/ptlib/common/contain.cxx. This can be exploited to cause a memory corruption by e.g. tricking an application using the library to use this function with a string longer than 1000 bytes.</desc>

		<desc>A vulnerability has been reported in Wesnoth, which can be exploited by malicious people to cause a DoS (Denial of Service).
			The vulnerability is caused due to an unspecified error in the processing of UTF-8 strings within the multiplayer engine . This can be exploited by malicious clients to crash a vulnerable Wesnoth client.</desc>

		<desc>Some vulnerabilities have been reported in libpng, which can be exploited by malicious people to cause a DoS (Denial of Service).
			1) Certain errors within libpng, including a logical NOT instead of a bitwise NOT in pngtrtran.c, an error in the 16bit cheap transparency extension, and an incorrect use of sizeof() may be exploited to crash an application using the library.
			2) Various out-of-bounds read errors exist within the functions "png_handle_pCAL()", "png_handle_sCAL()", "png_push_read_tEXt()", "png_handle_iTXt()", and "png_handle_ztXt()", which may be exploited by exploited to crash an application using the library.
			3) The vulnerability is caused due to an off-by-one error within the ICC profile chunk handling, which potentially can be exploited to crash an application using the library.</desc>
