		<desc>Some vulnerabilities have been reported in Ruby on Rails, which can be exploited by malicious people to disclose sensitive information and conduct cross-site scripting attacks.
			1) Input passed to the "to_json" function is not properly sanitised before being returned to the user. This can be exploited to execute arbitrary HTML and script code in a user's browser session in context of an affected site.
			2) An error in ActiveResource when processing responses using the "Hash.from_xml" function can be exploited to determine the existence of files and to read the contents of arbitrary XML files.
			3) A security issue is caused due to lib/action_controller/cgi_process.rb removing the ":cookie_only" attribute from "DEFAULT_SESSION_OPTIONS" and can be exploited to conduct session fixation attacks against applications using the affected component.</desc>

		<desc>Chris Evans has reported a vulnerability in Ghostscript, which can be exploited by malicious people to compromise a user's system.
			The vulnerability is caused due to a boundary error within the "zseticcspace()" function in zicc.c. This can be exploited to cause a stack-based buffer overflow via an overly large "Range" array.
			Successful exploitation allows execution of arbitrary code.</desc>

		<desc>Some security issues have been reported in lighttpd, which can be exploited by malicious people to disclose potentially sensitive information.
			1) A security issue is caused due to an error in mod_cgi, which can lead to the disclosure of source code when lighttpd is unable to fork.
			2) A security issue is caused due to the mod_userdir module using "$HOME" by default if no userdir.path is set. This can be exploited to disclose the content of arbitrary files on certain systems via e.g. the "nobody" user.</desc>
