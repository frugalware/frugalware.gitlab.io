		<desc>Jeremias Reith has reported a vulnerability in WordPress, which can be exploited by malicious people to conduct script insertion attacks.
		Input passed via the HTTP "Host" header is not properly sanitised before being used. This can be exploited to execute arbitrary HTML and script code in a user's browser session in context of an affected site if malicious data is viewed.
		Note: Reportedly, this only affects IP-based virtual servers running on Apache 2.x.</desc>

		<desc>Some vulnerabilities have been reported in the Linux kernel, which potentially can be exploited by malicious people to compromise a vulnerable system.
		1) The error-reporting functionality in (1) fs/ext2/dir.c, (2) fs/ext3/dir.c, and possibly (3) fs/ext4/dir.c in the Linux kernel 2.6.26.5 does not limit the number of printk console messages that report directory corruption, which allows physically proximate attackers to cause a denial of service (temporary system hang) by mounting a filesystem that has corrupted dir->i_size and dir->i_blocks values and performing (a) read or (b) write operations. NOTE: there are limited scenarios in which this crosses privilege boundaries.
                2) The i915 driver in (1) drivers/char/drm/i915_dma.c in the Linux kernel 2.6.24 on Debian GNU/Linux and (2) sys/dev/pci/drm/i915_drv.c in OpenBSD does not restrict the DRM_I915_HWS_ADDR ioctl to the Direct Rendering Manager (DRM) master, which allows local users to cause a denial of service (memory corruption) via a crafted ioctl call, related to absence of the DRM_MASTER and DRM_ROOT_ONLY flags in the ioctl's configuration.
		3) Linux kernel 2.6.28 allows local users to cause a denial of service ("soft lockup" and process loss) via a large number of sendmsg function calls, which does not block during AF_UNIX garbage collection and triggers an OOM condition, a different vulnerability than CVE-2008-5029.
		Successful exploitation of the vulnerabilities may allow execution of arbitrary code.</desc>

		<desc>Some vulnerabilities have been reported in CUPS, which potentially can be exploited by malicious people to compromise a vulnerable system.
		1) Two boundary errors exist in the implementation of the HP-GL/2 filter. These can be exploited to cause buffer overflows via HP-GL/2 files containing overly large pen numbers.
		2) A boundary error exists within the "read_rle16()" function when processing SGI (Silicon Graphics Image) files. This can be exploited to cause a heap-based buffer overflow via a specially crafted SGI file.
		3) An integer overflow error exists within the "WriteProlog()" function included in the "texttops" utility. This can be exploited to cause a heap-based buffer overflow via a specially crafted file.

		<desc>A security issue has been reported in OpenSC, which can be exploited by malicious people to bypass certain security restrictions.
		The security issue is caused due to the application improperly setting the ADMIN file control information to "00" while initializing smart cards having a Siemens CardOS M4 operating system. This can be exploited to change a user PIN code without having the PIN or PUK if the smart card was initialized with OpenSC.</desc>

		<desc>Multiple vulnerabilities have been reported in Adobe Reader/Acrobat, which can be exploited by malicious, local users to gain escalated privileges or by malicious people to compromise a user's system.
		1) A boundary error exists when parsing format strings containing a floating point specifier in the "util.printf()" Javascript function. This can be exploited to cause a stack-based buffer overflow via a specially crafted PDF and allows execution of arbitrary code.
		2) An out-of-bounds array indexing error when parsing embedded Type 1 fonts can be exploited to corrupt memory and may allow execution of arbitrary code.
		3) An error in an AcroJS function used to perform HTTP authentication can be exploited to corrupt memory via an overly long string passed to the function. This may allow execution of arbitrary code.
		4) An error when creating a Collab object and performing a specific sequence of actions on it can be exploited to corrupt memory. This may allow execution of arbitrary code.
		5) An unspecified error when parsing malformed PDF objects can be exploited to corrupt memory, which may allow execution of arbitrary code.
		6) An input validation error in the Download Manager used by Adobe Reader may allow code execution during the download process.
		7) An error in the Download Manager used by Adobe Reader may result in a user's Internet Security options being changed during the download process.
		8) An input validation error in a JavaScript method may allow code execution.
		9) An unspecified privilege escalation vulnerability exists in the version for UNIX/Linux.</desc>

		<desc>A weakness and two vulnerabilities have been reported in lighttpd, which can be exploited by malicious people to disclose potentially sensitive information, bypass certain security restrictions, and cause a DoS (Denial of Service).
		1) A vulnerability is caused due to a memory leak within the "http_request_parse()" function when processing duplicate request headers and can be exploited to exhaust all available memory.
		2) A vulnerability is caused due to the "mod_userdir" module not correctly handling filenames on case insensitive file systems. This can be exploited to e.g. disclose potentially sensitive information by sending requests with mixed upper and lowercase characters.
		3) A weakness is caused due to lighttpd not decoding requests before matching them with rewrite and redirect rules. This can be exploited to e.g. bypass the rewrite and redirect rules.</desc>

		<desc>Some vulnerabilities have been reported in the Drupal Content Construction Kit (CCK), which can be exploited by malicious users to conduct script insertion attacks.
			Input passed to some fields settings forms (e.g. "field label", "help text", "allowed values") is not properly sanitised before being used. This can be exploited to insert arbitrary HTML and script code, which will be executed in a user's browser session in context of an affected site when the malicious data is viewed.
			Successful exploitation requires "administer content" privileges.</desc>

		<desc>Stefan Esser has reported a vulnerability in WordPress, which can be exploited by malicious people to guess automatically generated passwords.
		The vulnerability is caused due to WordPress using a weak pseudo random number generator to generate passwords while leaking it's state information to an attacker. In combination with other attacks this can e.g. be exploited to recover the administrator's automatically generated password.</desc>

		<desc>Two vulnerabilities have been reported in Drupal, which can be exploited by malicious people and users to bypass certain security restrictions.
		1) A vulnerability is caused due to improper access restriction in the core upload module. This can be exploited to retrieve files attached to content, without valid credentials for accessing the content itself.
		Successful exploitation of this vulnerability requires valid user credentials and that the core upload module is enabled.
		2) A vulnerability is caused due to improper access restriction in the node module API. This can be exploited to bypass node validation under some unspecified circumstances. No further information is currently available.</desc>
