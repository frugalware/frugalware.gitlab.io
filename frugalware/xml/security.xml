		<desc>Some vulnerabilities have been discovered in GNU Enscript, which can be exploited by malicious people to compromise a vulnerable system.
			1) A vulnerability is caused due to a boundary error within the "read_special_escape()" function in src/psgen.c when processing the "setfilename" escape sequence. This can be exploited to cause a stack-based buffer overflow by tricking the user into converting a malicious file.
			2) A vulnerability is caused due to a boundary error within the "read_special_escape()" function in src/psgen.c when processing the "font" escape sequence. This can be exploited to cause a stack-based buffer overflow by tricking the user into converting a malicious file.
			Successful exploitation allows execution of arbitrary code, but requires that special escapes processing is enabled with the "-e" option.

		<desc>Some vulnerabilities have been reported in Mozilla Firefox, which can be exploited by malicious, local users to potentially disclose sensitive information, and by malicious people to conduct cross-site scripting attacks, bypass certain security restrictions, disclose sensitive information, or potentially to compromise a user's system.
			1) Multiple errors in the layout engine can be exploited to cause memory corruptions and potentially execute arbitrary code.
			2) Multiple errors in the Javascript engine can be exploited to cause memory corruptions and potentially execute arbitrary code.
			3) A chrome XBL method can be used in combination with "window.eval" to execute arbitrary Javascript code in the context of another web site
			4) An error when restoring a closed tab can be exploited to modify an input control's text value, which allows e.g. to disclose the content of a local file when a user re-opens a tab.
			5) An error in the processing of shortcut files can be exploited to execute arbitrary script code with chrome privileges e.g. via an HTML file that loads a privileged chrome document via a .desktop shortcut file.
			6) A security issue is caused due to cookies marked "HTTPOnly" being readable by Javascript via the "XMLHttpRequest.getResponseHeader" and "XMLHttpRequest.getAllResponseHeaders" APIs.
			7) A security issue is caused due to Firefox ignoring certain HTTP directives to not cache web pages ("Cache-Control: no-store" and "Cache-Control: no-cache" for HTTPS pages), which can be exploited to disclose potentially sensitive information via cached pages.</desc>

This can be exploited to trigger an infinite loop within the "__vcc_walk()" function in net/atm/proc.c by creating unassigned entries and then e.g. reading from /proc/net/atm/vc.

		<desc>Some vulnerabilities have been reported in Drupal, which can be exploited by malicious people to conduct cross-site request forgery and cross-site scripting attacks.

1) The application allows users to perform certain actions via HTTP requests without performing any validity checks to verify the requests. This can be exploited to perform certain operations (e.g. execute old updates) when a logged-in superuser visits a malicious web site.

2) The application does not completely remove deleted input formats. This can be exploited to execute arbitrary HTML and script code in a user's browser session in the context of an affected site.</desc>

		<desc>Some vulnerabilities have been reported in the Linux kernel, which potentially can be exploited by malicious people to compromise a vulnerable system.
		1) The error-reporting functionality in (1) fs/ext2/dir.c, (2) fs/ext3/dir.c, and possibly (3) fs/ext4/dir.c in the Linux kernel 2.6.26.5 does not limit the number of printk console messages that report directory corruption, which allows physically proximate attackers to cause a denial of service (temporary system hang) by mounting a filesystem that has corrupted dir->i_size and dir->i_blocks values and performing (a) read or (b) write operations. NOTE: there are limited scenarios in which this crosses privilege boundaries.
                2) The i915 driver in (1) drivers/char/drm/i915_dma.c in the Linux kernel 2.6.24 on Debian GNU/Linux and (2) sys/dev/pci/drm/i915_drv.c in OpenBSD does not restrict the DRM_I915_HWS_ADDR ioctl to the Direct Rendering Manager (DRM) master, which allows local users to cause a denial of service (memory corruption) via a crafted ioctl call, related to absence of the DRM_MASTER and DRM_ROOT_ONLY flags in the ioctl's configuration.
		3) Linux kernel 2.6.28 allows local users to cause a denial of service ("soft lockup" and process loss) via a large number of sendmsg function calls, which does not block during AF_UNIX garbage collection and triggers an OOM condition, a different vulnerability than CVE-2008-5029.
		Successful exploitation of the vulnerabilities may allow execution of arbitrary code.</desc>

		<desc>Some vulnerabilities have been reported in CUPS, which potentially can be exploited by malicious people to compromise a vulnerable system.
		1) Two boundary errors exist in the implementation of the HP-GL/2 filter. These can be exploited to cause buffer overflows via HP-GL/2 files containing overly large pen numbers.

		2) An out-of-bounds array indexing error when parsing embedded Type 1 fonts can be exploited to corrupt memory and may allow execution of arbitrary code.

		6) An input validation error in the Download Manager used by Adobe Reader may allow code execution during the download process.

		<desc>Two security issues have been reported in Dovecot, which can be exploited by malicious users to bypass certain security restrictions.
			1) The problem is that the ACL plugin interprets negative access rights as positive access rights, potentially giving an unprivileged user access to restricted resources.
			2) An error in the ACL plugin when imposing mailbox creation restrictions can be exploited to create "parent/child/child" mailboxes.</desc>

		<desc>Some vulnerabilities have been reported in MPlayer, which potentially can be exploited by malicious people to compromise a user's system.
		The vulnerabilities are caused due to multiple boundary errors within the "demux_real_fill_buffer()" function in libmpdemux/demux_real.c. These can be exploited to cause heap-based buffer overflows via specially crafted Real Media files.
		Successful exploitation may allow execution of arbitrary code.</desc>

		The vulnerability is caused due to the Django administration application not performing any validity checks to verify requests when re-authenticating the user. This can be exploited to delete and edit data when a not logged-in user e.g. visits a malicious web site and is then enticed to log in to the application.</desc>

		<desc>A weakness and two vulnerabilities have been reported in lighttpd, which can be exploited by malicious people to disclose potentially sensitive information, bypass certain security restrictions, and cause a DoS (Denial of Service).
		1) A vulnerability is caused due to a memory leak within the "http_request_parse()" function when processing duplicate request headers and can be exploited to exhaust all available memory.
		2) A vulnerability is caused due to the "mod_userdir" module not correctly handling filenames on case insensitive file systems. This can be exploited to e.g. disclose potentially sensitive information by sending requests with mixed upper and lowercase characters.
		3) A weakness is caused due to lighttpd not decoding requests before matching them with rewrite and redirect rules. This can be exploited to e.g. bypass the rewrite and redirect rules.</desc>

This can be exploited to insert arbitrary HTML and script code, which will be executed in a user's browser session in context of an affected site when the malicious data is viewed.

		<desc>Stefan Esser has reported a vulnerability in WordPress, which can be exploited by malicious people to guess automatically generated passwords.
		The vulnerability is caused due to WordPress using a weak pseudo random number generator to generate passwords while leaking it's state information to an attacker. In combination with other attacks this can e.g. be exploited to recover the administrator's automatically generated password.</desc>

		<desc>Two vulnerabilities have been reported in Drupal, which can be exploited by malicious people and users to bypass certain security restrictions.
		1) A vulnerability is caused due to improper access restriction in the core upload module. This can be exploited to retrieve files attached to content, without valid credentials for accessing the content itself.
		Successful exploitation of this vulnerability requires valid user credentials and that the core upload module is enabled.
		2) A vulnerability is caused due to improper access restriction in the node module API. This can be exploited to bypass node validation under some unspecified circumstances. No further information is currently available.</desc>
