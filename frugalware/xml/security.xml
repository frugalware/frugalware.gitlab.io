		<desc>A weakness and some vulnerabilities have been reported in Drupal, which can be exploited by malicious users to conduct script insertion attacks, and by malicious users and malicious people to bypass certain security restrictions.
			1) A vulnerability in the OpenID module is caused due to incorrect protocol implementation. This can be exploited to harvest positive assertions from OpenID providers and e.g. bypass the login mechanism by replaying intercepted assertions.
			2) The weakness is caused due to an error in the upload module, which does not properly check uploaded file names for case sensitivity and grants access to the earlier uploaded file. This can be exploited to download otherwise restricted files by uploading similarly named file with different letter casing.
			3) An error in the comment module does not properly check for access permissions before republishing previously unpublished comments.
			Successful exploitation of this vulnerability requires "post comments without approval" permissions.
			4) Input passed via descriptions and messages while using the actions feature is not properly sanitised before being displayed to the user via nodes and taxonomy terms. This can be exploited to insert arbitrary HTML and script code, which will be executed in a user's browser session in context of an affected site when the malicious data is being viewed.
			Successful exploitation of this vulnerability requires "administer actions" permissions.</desc>

		<desc>Multiple vulnerabilities have been reported in the Views module for Drupal, which can be exploited by malicious people to conduct cross-site request forgery, and cross-site scripting attacks.
			1) The Views UI module allows users to perform certain actions via HTTP requests without performing any validity checks to verify the requests. This can be exploited to e.g. enable or disable all Views in a site when a logged-in user visits a malicious site.
			This vulnerability is reported in versions prior to 5.x-1.8 and 6.x-2.11.
			Successful exploitation requires that Views UI module is enabled.
			2) Input passed via URLs or aggregator feed titles are not properly sanitised before being used. This can be exploited to insert arbitrary HTML and script code, which will be executed in a user's browser session in context of an affected site when the malicious data is returned to the user.</desc>

		<desc>Multiple vulnerabilities have been reported in OpenSSL:
			1) A vulnerability is caused due to certain applications (e.g. Apache with the PHP module) calling OpenSSL's "CRYPTO_free_all_ex_data()" function prematurely. In certain cases, this can result in memory leaks, which can be exploited to e.g. cause a DoS due to memory exhaustion.
			2) A vulnerability is caused due to an error in the TLS protocol while handling session re-negotiations. This can be exploited to insert arbitrary plaintext before data sent by a legitimate client in an existing TLS session via Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attacks.
			Successful exploitation may allow e.g. sending an arbitrary HTTP request under an authenticated context if certificate-based authentication is used by the server.
			4) A vulnerability is caused due to the library not properly verifying the return value of the "bn_wexpand()" function.
			1) The library does not limit the number of buffered DTLS records with a future epoch. This can be exploited to exhaust all available memory via specially crafted DTLS packets.
			5) An error when processing DTLS messages can be exploited to exhaust all available memory by sending a large number of out of sequence handshake messages.
			6) A use-after-free error in the "dtls1_retrieve_buffered_fragment()" function can be exploited to cause a crash in a client context.
			7) An error in the "dtls1_process_out_of_seq_message()" function can be exploited to crash a DTLS server via a specially crafted out of sequence DTLS packet.
			8) The "kssk_keytab_is_available()" function in ssl/kssl.c does not check the return value of a call to the "krb5_sname_to_principal()" function, which can be exploited to cause a NULL pointer dereference by e.g. sending certain cipher suites within the client hello.
			9) An error exists within the "ssl3_get_record()" function in openssl/ssl/s3_pkt.c when processing certain records, which can be exploited to cause a crash by sending specially crafted records.
			10) A vulnerability is caused due to an error when handling CMS (Cryptographic Message Syntax) structures. This can be exploited to trigger a write to an invalid memory address or a double-free via a specially crafted CMS structure containing an "OriginatorInfo" element.</desc>

			2) A race condition exists when creating backup files, which can be exploited to take the ownership of arbitrary files via e.g. symlink attacks.
			Successful exploitation requires that the victim is tricked into editing files owned by the attacker and that the backup functionality is enabled.</desc>

		<desc>Dan Rosenberg reported two security issues in glibc:
			1) "ncpmount" and "mount.cifs" failed to properly sanitize provided mountpoint directory names (specifically, special characters such as newlines were not stripped). An attacker could create a directory with newline characters in its name and issue an ncpmount / mount.cifs command to mount to that directory, allowing them to corrupt /etc/mtab and potentially add unauthorized mounting options for other devices.
			2) A memory corruption vulnerability in ld.so: When processing maliciously crafted ELF binaries using ld.so, regardless of whether execution of those binaries is intended (for example, using the "--verify" flag, which should not lead to any code execution), arbitrary code execution can be achieved.</desc>

		<desc>Multiple vulnerabilities have been reported in Sun Java, where some have an unknown impact and others can be exploited by malicious people to manipulate certain data, disclose potentially sensitive information, cause a DoS (Denial of Service), or compromise a vulnerable system.
			1) An error in the implementation of the "HeadspaceSoundbank" class can be exploited to cause a stack-based buffer overflow via a crafted Soundbank file with an overly long name.
			2) An error in the implementation of the "HeadspaceSoundbank" class can be exploited to cause a heap-based buffer overflow via a crafted Soundbank file with an overly long record.
			3) An input validation error in the processing of image files can be exploited to cause a heap-based buffer overflow, e.g. if a user visits a web page containing a specially crafted java applet.
			Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities allows execution of arbitrary code.
			4) Unspecified vulnerabilities exist in the ImageIO, Java 2D, Java Runtime Environment, Java Web Start, Java Plug-in, Pack200, Sound, and HotSpot Server components.
			5) An error in the JSSE component while handling TLS session re-negotiations can be exploited to manipulate certain data.
			5) An unspecified error in the Java Web Start, Java Plug-in component can be exploited to manipulate certain data or cause a DoS.
			6) Two unspecified errors in the Java Runtime Environment can be exploited to disclose unspecified information.

		<desc>Some vulnerabilities have been reported in Drupal, which can be exploited by malicious users to conduct script insertion attacks and bypass certain security restrictions.
			1) Input passed via the "langcode", "name", and "native" parameters in the languages interface while using the Locale module is not properly sanitised before being displayed to the user. This can be exploited to insert arbitrary HTML and script code, which will be executed in a user's browser session in context of an affected site when the malicious data is being viewed.
			Successful exploitation requires "administer languages" permissions.
			2) An error in the handling of certain sessions can be exploited to maintain an open session despite the user being blocked.

		<desc>Braden Thomas from Apple has discovered a signature verification bypass issue in xar.  The issue is that xar_open assumes that the checksum is stored at offset 0, but xar_signature_copy_signed_data uses xar property "checksum/offset" to find the offset to the checksum when validating the signature.  As a result, a modified xar archive can pass signature validation by putting the checksum for the modified TOC at offset 0, pointing "checksum/offset" at the non-modified checksum at a higher offset, and using the original non-modified signature.</desc>
