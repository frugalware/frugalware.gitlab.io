		<desc>Ivan Fratric has reported a vulnerability in PHP, which potentially can be exploited by malicious people to cause a DoS (Denial of Service). The vulnerability is caused due to an integer overflow within the "readwbmp()" function in ext/gd/libgd/wbmp.c. This can be exploited to e.g. cause a DoS by tricking a PHP script into loading a specially crafted wbmp image.
			Stefan Esser has reported some vulnerabilities in PHP, which can be exploited by malicious users to compromise a vulnerable system.
			1) A double free error within the "session_regenerate_id()" function can be exploited to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the PHP interpreter.
			2) An error in the "array_user_key_compare()" function where key references are incorrectly destroyed can be exploited to cause memory corruption.
			3) An error exists within the "unserialize()" function when unserialising specially escaped S: data types. This can be exploited to e.g. disclose certain parts of the heap memory.
			A vulnerability is caused due to the use of an incorrect regular expression within the "FILTER_VALIDATE_EMAIL" filter of the ext/filter extension. This can be exploited to inject newlines via specially crafted email addresses, which may allow mail header injection.
			Also fixes the following MOPB vulnerabilities:

			Due to insufficient sanitation, smb4k_mount allowed an user to mount any (local) device if the program was used in combination with sudo or super.
			The function findprog(), which was in present smb4k_mount, smb4k_umount, and smb4k_kill, returned a pointer to memory that was freed when the function exited.
			The function replace_special_characters(), that was present in smb4k_mount and smb4k_umount, returned a pointer to memory that was freed after the function exited. Additionally, it didn't replace the hyphen.</desc>

			2) An integer overflow exists within the parsing of the "fonts.dir" fonts information file. This can be exploited to cause a heap-based buffer overflow via a specially crafted fonts information file that specifies an element count of more than 1,073,741,824 in the first line. Successful exploitation may allow the execution of arbitrary code with escalated privileges.
			3) An input validation error exists within the "ProcXCMiscGetXIDList()" function of the XC-MISC extension. This can be exploited to cause a stack-based (if the "alloca()" function is available) or heap-based memory corruption by passing specially crafted parameters to the function. Successful exploitation may allow the execution of arbitrary code with escalated privileges.
			4) An integer overflow exists within the "XGetPixel()" function in ImUtil.c. This can be exploited to cause a crash or disclose potentially sensitive information by passing specially crafted parameters to the function.</desc>

		<desc>A security issue has been reported in TrueCrypt, which can be exploited by malicious, local users to cause a DoS (Denial of Service). The problem is that users are able to dismount volumes mounted by other users when the set-euid mode in Linux is used.
			Tim Rees has discovered a security issue in TrueCrypt, which can be exploited by malicious, local users to cause a DoS (Denial of Service) or gain escalated privileges.
			The security issue is caused if the "truecrypt" binary is installed setuid root. This can be exploited to cause a DoS or gain escalated privileges by e.g. mounting a malicious TrueCrypt disk into /usr/bin or another user's home directory. Successful exploitation requires that TrueCrypt is installed setuid root (not default setting).</desc>

		<desc>Luigi Auriemma has reported some vulnerabilities in Network Audio System, which potentially can be exploited by malicious, local users to gain escalated privileges or by malicious people to cause a DoS (Denial of Service).
			1) A boundary error within "accept_att_local()" in server/os/connection.c can be exploited to cause a stack-based buffer overflow via an overly long (greater than 64 bytes) slave name in a USL connection. Successful exploitation may allow malicious, local users to gain root privileges.
			2) An input validation error within "AddResource()" in server/dia/resource.c can be exploited to cause the service to crash via a specially crafted packet with an invalid client ID.
			3) An integer-overflow error within "ProcAuWriteElement()" in server/dia/audispatch.c can be exploited to cause the service to crash via a specially crafted packet with an overly large max_samples value.
			4) A boundary error within "ProcAuSetElements()" in server/dia/audispatch.c can be exploited to cause the service to crash via a specially crafted packet with an overly large num_actions or numElements value.
			5) An input validation error within "compileInputs()" in server/dia/auutil.c can be exploited to cause the service to crash via a specially crafted packet with an invalid element number.
			6) A NULL-pointer dereference error when processing simultaneous connections can be exploited to cause the service to crash.</desc>

		<desc>Some vulnerabilities have been reported in the Linux Kernel, which can be exploited by malicious, local users to cause a DoS (Denial of Service).
			1) Listening IPv6 TCP sockets are incorrectly sharing the "ipv6_fl_socklist" IPv6 flowlist with child sockets. This can be exploited to e.g. cause a kernel crash by performing certain actions on IPv6 TCP sockets.
			2) The "hrtimer_forward()" does not correctly check for "timer->expires" overflows on 64bit machines. This can be exploited to cause a DoS by using very large timer values. Successful exploitation may require a 64bit machine and that high resolution timers are enabled.
			3) A NULL pointer dereference within the "do_ipv6_setsockopt()" function in net/ipv6/ipv6_sockglue.c can be exploited to cause a kernel crash by calling "setsockopt()" with malicious parameters.</desc>

		<desc>The FTP protocol includes the PASV (passive) command which is used by Firefox to request an alternate data port. The specification of the FTP protocol allows the server response to include an alternate server address as well, although this is rarely used in practice.
			mark@bindshell.net reported that a malicious web page hosted on a specially-coded FTP server could use this feature to perform a rudimentary port-scan of machines inside the firewall of the victim. By itself this causes no harm, but information about an internal network may be useful to an attacker should there be other vulnerabilities present on the network.</desc>
