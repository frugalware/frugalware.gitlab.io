		<desc>Sean Larsson has reported some vulnerabilities in X.Org X11, which can be exploited by malicious, local users to gain escalated privileges.
			The vulnerabilities are caused due to input validation errors within the "ProcRenderAddGlyphs()" function of the "Render" extension, and the "ProcDbeGetVisualInfo()" and "ProcDbeSwapBuffers()" functions of the "DBE" extension. This can be exploited to cause memory corruption by sending specially crafted X requests to the X server.
			Successful exploitation may allow the execution of arbitrary code with the privileges of the X server, but requires that the "Render" or "DBE" extensions are loaded.</desc>

		<desc>rgod has discovered four vulnerabilities in Cacti, which can be exploited by malicious people to bypass certain security restrictions, manipulate data and compromise vulnerable systems.
			1) The "cmd.php" and "copy_cacti_user.php" scripts do not properly restrict access to command line usage and are installed in a web-accessible location.
			Successful exploitation requires that "register_argc_argv" is enabled.
			2) Input passed in the URL to cmd.php is not properly sanitised before being used in SQL queries. This can be exploited to manipulate SQL queries by injecting arbitrary SQL code.
			Successful exploitation requires that "register_argc_argv" is enabled.
			3) The results from the SQL queries in 2) in cmd.php are not properly sanitised before being used as shell commands. This can be exploited to inject arbitrary shell commands.
			4) Input passed in the URL to copy_cacti_user.php is not properly sanitised before being used in SQL queries. This can be exploited to manipulate SQL queries by injecting arbitrary SQL code.
			Successful exploitation allows adding new administrator users, but requires that "register_argc_argv" is enabled.
			Furthermore, it has been reported that other scripts may be exploitable under certain conditions. It has also been reported that script_server.php can be exploited to cause a DoS (denial of service).</desc>

		<desc>Some vulnerabilities have been discovered in phpBB, which can be exploited by malicious people to conduct cross-site request forgery attacks and cross-site scripting attacks.
			1) The application allows users to send messages via HTTP requests without performing any validity checks to verify the request. This can be exploited to send messages to arbitrary users by e.g. tricking a target user into visiting a malicious website.
			2) Input passed to the form field "Message body" in privmsg.php is not properly sanitised before it is returned to the user when sending messages to a non-existent user. This can be exploited to execute arbitrary HTML and script code in a user's browser session in context of an affected site.
			Successful exploitation of the vulnerabilities requires that the target user is logged in.</desc>

		<desc>The code mentioned in DSA 1244-1 is also included in MPlayer. A potential buffer overflow was found in the code used to handle RealMedia RTSP streams. When checking for matching asm rules, the code stores the results in a fixed-size array, but no boundary checks are performed. This may lead to a buffer overflow if the user is tricked into connecting to a malicious server. Since the attacker can not write arbitrary data into the buffer, creating an exploit is very hard; but a DoS attack is easily made.</desc>

		<desc>Multiple vulnerabilities have been reported in Mozilla SeaMonkey, which can be exploited by malicious people to conduct cross-site scripting attacks and potentially compromise a user's system.
			1)Various errors in the layout engine and JavaScript engine can be exploited to cause memory corruption and some may potentially allow execution of arbitrary code.
			2) An error when reducing the CPU's floating point precision, which may happen on Windows when loading a plugin creating a Direct3D device, may cause the "js_dtoa()" function to not exit and instead cause a memory corruption.
			3) A boundary error when setting the cursor to a Windows bitmap using the CSS cursor property can be exploited to cause a heap-based buffer overflow.
			4) An unspecified error in the "watch()" JavaScript function can be exploited to execute arbitrary code.
			5) An error in LiveConnect causes an already freed object to be used and may potentially allow execution of arbitrary code.
			6) An error in the handling of the "src" attribute of IMG elements loaded in a frame can be exploited to change the attribute to a "javascript:" URI. This allows execution of arbitrary HTML and script code in a user's browser session.
			7) An error within the handling of SVG comment objects can be exploited to cause a memory corruption and allows execution of arbitrary code by appending an SVG comment object from one document into another type of document (e.g. HTML).
			8) A boundary error within the processing of mail headers can be exploited to cause a heap-based buffer overflow via an overly long "Content-Type" header in an external message body.
			9) A boundary error within the processing of rfc2047-encoded headers can be exploited to cause a heap-based buffer overflow.</desc>

			2) A buffer overflow exists in the libmms library: Anon Sricharoenchai has discovered some vulnerabilities in MiMMS, which can be exploited by malicious people to cause a DoS (Denial of Service) and potentially to compromise a user's system.
			The vulnerabilities are caused due to boundary errors within the "get_header()" and "get_media_packet" functions when read data from the server. This can be exploited to cause stack-based buffer overflows and may allow arbitrary code execution.</desc>

		<desc>Some vulnerabilities have been reported in SquirrelMail, which can be exploited by malicious people to conduct cross-site scripting and script insertion attacks.
			1) Input passed to certain parameters in webmail.php and compose.php in the "draft", "compose", and "mailto" functionality is not properly sanitised before being returned to the user. This can be exploited to execute arbitrary HTML and script code in a user's browser session in context of an affected site.
			2) Input validation errors exist in the magicHTML filter when sanitising HTML mails. This can be exploited to insert arbitrary HTML and script code, which is executed in a user's browser session in context of an affected site when the malicious data is viewed.
			Successful exploitation of some of these errors require that the target user runs Microsoft Internet Explorer.</desc>

		<desc>Some vulnerabilities have been reported in Mozilla Firefox and Mozilla SeaMonkey, which can be exploited by malicious people to bypass certain security restrictions, conduct cross-site scripting attacks, and potentially compromise a vulnerable system.
			1) The bundled Network Security Services (NSS) library contains an incomplete fix for the RSA signature verification vulnerability reported in MFSA 2006-60.
			2) An error exists within the handling of Script objects. This can potentially be exploited to execute arbitrary JavaScript bytecode by modifying already running Script objects.
			3) Some unspecified errors in the layout engine and memory corruption errors in the JavaScript engine can be exploited to crash the application and may allow execution of arbitrary code.
			4) An unspecified error within XML.prototype.hasOwnProperty can potentially be exploited to execute arbitrary code.</desc>
