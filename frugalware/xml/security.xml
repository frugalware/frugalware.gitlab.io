		<desc>Some vulnerabilities have been reported in OpenSSL, which can be exploited by malicious people to bypass certain security restrictions or cause a DoS (Denial of Service).
1) An error exists in the "ASN1_STRING_print_ex()" function when printing "BMPString" or "UniversalString" strings. This can be exploited to trigger an access to invalid memory and cause a crash via an illegal encoded string length when e.g. printing the contents of a certificate.
2) The "CMS_verify()" function incorrectly handles an error condition when processing malformed signed attributes. This can be exploited to trick an application into considering a malformed set of signed attributes valid and skip further checks.
Successful exploitation requires access to a previously generated invalid signature.
3) An error when processing malformed ASN1 structures can be exploited to trigger an access to invalid memory and cause a crash via a specially crafted certificate.</desc>

		<desc>Some vulnerabilities, security issues, and a weakness have been reported in Mozilla Firefox, which can be exploited by malicious people to disclose potentially sensitive information, bypass certain security restrictions, conduct cross-site scripting and cross-site request forgery attacks, and potentially compromise a user's system.
			1) Multiple errors in the browser engine can be exploited to corrupt memory and potentially execute arbitrary code.
			2) Multiple errors in the JavaScript engine can be exploited to corrupt memory and potentially execute arbitrary code.
			3) An error exists when the "jar:" scheme is used to wrap a URI, which serves content with "Content-Disposition: attachment". This can be exploited to e.g. conduct cross-site scripting attacks on sites that allow users to upload arbitrary content, which is served as "application/java-archive" or "application/x-jar", and that rely on the HTTP header "Content-Disposition: attachment" to prevent potentially untrusted content.
			4) An error when loading a Adobe Flash file via the "view-source:" scheme can be exploited to conduct cross-site request forgery attacks or read and write Local Shared Objects on a user's system e.g. for tracking purposes.
			5) An error in the processing of XBL bindings can be exploited to conduct script insertion attacks on sites that allow user to embed third-party stylesheets.
			6) Errors in "XMLHttpRequest" and "XPCNativeWrapper.toString" can be exploited to bypass the same-origin policy and potentially execute code with chrome privileges.
			7) A weakness in the handling of "SearchForm" URIs can be exploited to execute arbitrary script code in the context of an arbitrary site when a user performs an empty search in a specially crafted plugin.
			8) An error in the handling of POST data may result in unintended information disclosure. When an inner frame of a web page is saved as file POST data of the outer page is sent to the URL of the inner frame.
			9) An error in the processing of the "Refresh" header can potentially be exploited to conduct cross-site scripting attacks.
			10) A vulnerability is caused due to an error when calling the "nsTextFrame::ClearTextRun()" function and can be exploited to corrupt memory.</desc>

		<desc>Some vulnerabilities have been reported in udev, which can be exploited by malicious, local users to cause a DoS (Denial of Service) or gain escalated privileges.
			1) A vulnerability is caused due to udev not properly verifying the credentials of received NETLINK messages. This can be exploited to gain escalated privileges by sending multicast NETLINK messages.
			2) A vulnerability is caused due to a boundary error within the "util_path_encode()" function in udev/lib/libudev-util.c. This can be exploited to cause a crash by providing specially crafted input.</desc>

		<desc>Some vulnerabilities have been reported in Drupal, which can be exploited by malicious people to conduct script insertion attacks or to disclose potentially sensitive information.
			1) User provided input is not properly sanitised before being used. This can be exploited to insert arbitrary HTML and script code, which will be executed in a user's browser session in context of an affected site when the malicious data is viewed and interpreted as UTF-7.
			Successful exploitation requires the ability to post content.
			2) An unspecified error can be exploited to disclose information about form submissions when a user is tricked into submitting a form after following a specially crafted link to the site. This can further be exploited to conduct e.g. cross-site request forgery attacks.</desc>

		<desc>A vulnerability has been reported in Blender, which can be exploited by malicious, local users to gain escalated privileges.
			The vulnerability is caused due to Blender using the current working directory as part of the module search path, which can be exploited to e.g. execute arbitrary Python code with the privileges of another user by tricking the user into executing Blender in a directory containing a Python file named like one of the modules Blender uses.</desc>

		<desc>Some vulnerabilities have been reported in phpMyAdmin, which can be exploited by malicious people to conduct cross-site scripting attacks or compromise a vulnerable system.
			1) Input passed via export page cookies is not properly sanitised before being returned to the user. This can be exploited to execute arbitrary HTML and script code in a user's browser session in the context of an affected site.

		<desc>Some vulnerabilities have been reported in Wireshark, which can potentially be exploited by malicious people to cause a DoS (Denial of Service) and compromise a user's system.
			1) A vulnerability is caused due to a format string error within the PN-DCP dissector when processing station names containing format string specifiers. This can be exploited to cause a crash and potentially execute arbitrary code via specially crafted packets captured off the wire or loaded via a capture file.
			2) An error within the Check Point High-Availability Protocol (CPHAP) dissector can be exploited to cause a crash.</desc>
