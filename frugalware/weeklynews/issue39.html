<p><h2>Frugalware Linux Newsletter - Issue 39</h2></p>

<p><h2>...to inform...to educate...to entertain</h2></p>

<p>"What we have done for ourselves alone dies with us; what we have done for others and the world remains and is immortal."  <em>Albert Pike</em></p>


<h2>Welcome</h2>

<p>The newsletter's aim is to keep you up to date with what's happened recently in the world of the Linux distribution 'Frugalware'.</p>

<p>Features of this issue include:
    <ul>
        <li>Microblog me!</li>
        <li>New FrugalBuild contributors!</li>
        <li>Frugalware's users are people too - Fafab</li>
        <li>Tips and tricks - Firefox extension - Read It Later</li>
    </ul>
</p>


<h2>Events</h2>

<p>Here's a selection of events which have occurred since the previous newsletter:</p>

<h3>Microblog me!</h3>
<p>Devil505 recently set up a Frugalware identity on the micro-blogging web sites Twitter and identi.ca.  Micro-blogging sites allow you to post brief messages and subscribe to messages being posted by others.  If you have an account on either of these services, you can subscribe to Frugalware's messages, including package updates.  On identi.ca you can also join the Frugalware group, which subscribes you to all messages being posted by the group's members.</p>

<h3>New FrugalBuild contributors!</h3>
<p>It's been exciting to see that, amongst the other Frugalware package updates, there have been several FrugalBuilds contributed by new contributors - Othmane Benkirane and Cedrick Hannier.  With the number of Frugalware packages increasing, new contributors are always welcome and we hope they soon become official developers.</p>

<h3>New German mirror</h3>
<p>Tobias Offermann recently offered to host a new Frugalware mirror in Germany and shortly after, the mirror was up and running.  Many thanks to Tobias and Host Europe (Germany) for providing this service.  The support of companies and individuals is always welcome since without their support, Frugalware may not exist.</p>

<h3>I feel so invalid! :P</h3>
<p>I recently thought I should take my own advice and test the HTML validity of a recent newsletter issue.  The result was that the <a href="http://validator.w3.org/">W3C validator</a> reported several hundred warnings and errors.  Wow!  After being embarrassed, I looked at the results in detail.  Most of the errors and warnings were produced by the mis-use of just one tag, which I hope to fix soon.  This proves that I have a little work to do before the newsletter is truly valid HTML.</p>

<h3>There's more to life than Frugalware</h3>
<p>As VMiklos recently said in an email to the Frugalware developers' mailing list, many Frugalware developers are active contributors to other FLOSS projects.  VMiklos himself developed Bitlbee-Skype, a plugin for <a href="http://www.bitlbee.org">Bitlbee</a> which allows messages to be sent to and from a running instance of Skype.  On the <a href="http://vmiklos.hu/project/bitlbee-skype/">Bitlbee-Skype</a> plugin web page, VMiklos has collected messages of thanks from its users.  The most interesting for me was the message from a blind Skype user, which says:</p>
 "Thanks for bitlbee-skype. As a blind Linux user, I cannot use the skype GUI client because qt apps ar not accessible yet with the available
screen readers. bitlbee-skype allows me to make use of skype without having to interact much with the GUI client, which helps me a lot."  I think it's fantastic when technology can help people overcome problems like these.  Well done to VMiklos!</p>

<h3>A new kernel</h3>
<p>Frugalware 1.0 features the Linux kernel version 2.6.28.  This kernel is exciting geeks throughout the Linux world, with new features including the ext4 file system.  Although ext4 is the successor to ext3, support for ext3 will remain for a long time.  Among its other features, ext4 is faster during file system checks because it checks only those parts of the file system that have changed since the previous check.</p>


<h2>Upgrades</h2>

<p>Here's a selection of packages which have been upgraded since the previous newsletter:</p>

<h2>Getting To Know You</h2>

<p>In this section of the newsletter, we get to know Frugalware Linux a little at a time.  This is not meant to replace the official documentation but instead make it easier to read.  This should suit those people who, like me, have short attention spans.  :)</p>

<h3>Is Frugalware up to date?</h3>
<p>For every Frugalware package, the following checks are completed automatically, at least once a day:</p>

<ul>
    <li>is there a later version of this application/library?;</li>
    <li>has this package been updated within the past year?;</li>
    <li>is this package available on both 32-bit and 62-bit platforms?</li>
</ul>

<p>For those that are out of date, each maintainer then has responsibility for updating their assigned packages.  In some circumstances we may choose not to upgrade to the very latest version.  Those packages which haven't been updated within the past year <strong>may</strong> be removed from the repositories in the future.  Those which are not available in 64-bit may need this option added, or simply may not be 64-bit compatible.</p>

<p>These tests ensure that Frugalware remains a "fresh" distribution, compatible with both 32-bit and 64-bit platforms.</p>


<h2>Tips and tricks</h2>

<p><b>Disclaimer</b> - Be aware that the hints &amp; tips provided here have NOT been tested and so come with no warranty.</p>

<h3>Ubuntu Pocket Guide</h3>
<p>I'm recommending the <a href="http://www.ubuntupocketguide.com">Ubuntu Pocket Guide</a> but please, don't launch the hate mail yet, because there are several reasons for recommending this book.    First, it contains valuable information that's useful to everyone who uses Linux.  Second, it's available for free in PDF format.  It covers topics such as file and folder permissions, security, command line basics.  Of course there's some content which is specific to Ubuntu - e.g. package management - but if you ignore these sections, you have a very useful book.</p>

<h3>Time it!</h3>
<p>It can be very useful to know just how long it took to run a command entered at the command line.  If you add "<code>time</code>" at the front of the command, the duration is output when the command is complete.  For example - "<code>time ls</code>".</p>

<h3>Mirror cracked?</h3>
<p>pacman-g2 will automatically try to download a package from all the mirrors in its list.  If a package isn't available at mirror 1, it moves on to mirror 2 and so on.  Mirrors synchronise with the master packages site on their own schedule, with some synchronising more often than others.  The following web page gives you an overview of the status of all Frugalware package mirrors - <a href="http://frugalware.org/~vmiklos/stats/mirmon">http://frugalware.org/~vmiklos/stats/mirmon</a></p>

<p>This section relies on your contributions! If have some tips and tricks that you would like to be shown in the newsletter, <em>please</em> post them on the forums.</p>


<h2>Focus On Package(s)</h2>

<h3>Erase that data!</h3>
<p>"<a href="http://bleachbit.sourceforge.net">BleachBit</a> deletes unnecessary files to free valuable disk space, maintain privacy, and remove junk. Rid your system of old clutter including cache, cookies, Internet history, localizations, logs, temporary files, and broken shortcuts. Designed for Linux systems, it wipes clean Adobe Reader, APT, Bash, Beagle, Epiphany, Firefox, Flash, GIMP, Google Earth, Java, KDE, OpenOffice.org, Opera, RealPlayer, rpmbuild, Second Live viewer, Skype, VIM, XChat, Yum, and more."</p>

<h3>Firefox extension - Read It Later</h3>
<p><a href="http://www.ideashower.com/ideas/launched/read-it-later/">Read It Later</a> allows you to easily maintain a list of those web sites/pages that you find interesting but don't have time to read immediately.  It's better than bookmarking them because if you only want to read them once, you then have to find and remove the bookmark.  With Read It Later, if you decide you want to bookmark the site, you can quickly do that.  If a link in a web site looks interesting, you can add the link to your list, so you don't have to navigate to the site itself.  It even has an offline mode, where it can download all the pages in your list to Firefox's cache, so that you can read them in 'Offline Mode'.</p>


<h2>Bug fixes</h2>

<p>The following table gives you a overview of activity on bugs and feature requests as at 19 February 2009.  In each cell of the table is a link to a detailed list of the relevant bugs or feature requests.</p>
