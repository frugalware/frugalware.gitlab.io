<h2>News</h2>
<p>
	Here's what's happened over the last few weeks:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		<h3>0.7pre1 released!</h3>
		We have released the first pre-release of the upcoming 0.7 release! Anyone who would like to help make 0.7 the best and most bug-free release yet, please download the ISOs and test them! There are currently a few known issues: Glibc 2.6-1 causes some apps (mainly firefox and thunderbird) to die sometimes with malloc errors. To resolve this, run pacman-g2 -Syu after installation.
	</li>
	<li>
		<h3>GCC Java Web Plugin</h3>
		As of gcc-4.2.0-3, there is a usable java browser plugin for systems where the binary is not available, like x86_64. See <a href="http://frugalware.org/docs/packages.html#toc28">this page</a> for more information.
	</li>
	<li>
		<h3>Pacman-Tools improvements</h3>
		Pacman-tools now provides a fwmakepkg man page, which is a good for people who want to learn to build packages. Repoman now also supports nobuild packages (like opera, vmware, etc). This means that these packages now show up on our homepage search. 
	</li>
	<li>
		<h3>New i686 build server</h3>
		Thanks to the generous donations of a lot of people, we now have a new i686 build server! This server now runs a Pentium 4 processor with 768MB RAM, so i686 packages should be built much faster. Thanks everyone!
	</li>
	<li>
		<h3>Homepage design contest</h3>
		Just a reminder that we are running a homepage design contest. If anyone wants to try making a design for our homepage, look at <a href="/newsletter/3">issue 3 of the newsletter</a> for more info! The contest has been extended to next Friday (8th of June) to wait for some entries that we know are in progress.
	</li>
	<li>
		<h3>New developer</h3>
		We'd like to take this opportunity to welcome our new developer, detto. He has already contributed several packages to Frugalware, and some tips and tricks for the newsletter. We hope he'll enjoy being a developer!
	</li>
	<li>
		<h3>Forums to Mailing list gateway</h3>
		We now have a gateway between the forums and the frugalware-forums mailing list. All the messages posted to the frugalware-forums mailing list are posted to the forums and all the posts from the "Mailing list" section of the forum are posted to the mailing list.
	</li>
</ul>

		<h3>Hiding the Trash icon in XFCE</h3>
		Create a file named 'xfdesktoprc' in /home/your_user_name/.config/xfce4/desktop/ and add the following line(s) to it:
		<pre><code>
		[file-icons]
		show-trash=false
		</code></pre>
		Restart Xfce after making the changes and the trash icon will no longer be displayed.
