<a name="events"><h2>Events</h2></a>

<p>Here's a selection of events which have occurred since the previous newsletter:</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        <h3>Gnome 2.24 has arrived at repo near you</h3>
        <p>For those that don't already know, Gnome 2.24 was recently released.  Bouleetbil has been very busy recently, packaging the latest release and its associated applications.  There's a lot of work involved in packaging something as big a Gnome so a big <em>thankyou</em> goes to Bouleetbil for his work.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h3>XFCE 4.6 alpha's packaging is underway</h3>
        <p>The XFCE 4 development team recently released an alpha of their new release - 4.6.  Priyank has been busy, packaging this in a work-in-progress repository.  This repository allows testing of the new release by approved testers.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h3>And you thought Frugalware's developers were too serious :P</h3>
        <p>During a recent discussion in IRC about the graphical installer that's in development, DeX77 and vmiklos began discussing wives and girlfriends.  I don't know how the discussion started, but for the record, here are their wise words:</p>

<pre>
   &lt DeX77 &gt     am I the only one thinking "Fwife" is a not so good name? ;)
   &lt vmiklos &gt   i think it's a minor detail atm.
                 but i have no idea what Fhusband will do, then :]
   &lt DeX77 &gt     just call it Fgirlfriend for now and upgrade to wife in v 2.0 ;)
   &lt vmiklos &gt   pf :)

<a name="gettingtoknowyou"><h2>Getting To Know You</h2></a>

    <p>In this section of the newsletter, we get to know Frugalware Linux a little at a time.  This is not meant to replace the official documentation but instead present the same information in small "bites".  This should suit those people who, like me, have short attention spans.  :)</p>

    <h3>"What does the '-g2' in pacman-g2 mean"?</h3>
    <p>pacman-g2 was once named "pacman" - i.e. there was no "-g2" on the end of the name.  At that time the version of pacman used by Frugalware was the same as that used by the Arch Linux distribution.  When it became clear that the changes proposed for pacman by  the Frugalware developers weren't going to be accepted by the Arch Linux developers, pacman was forked.  The "-g2" suffix was added to pacman's name to make it clear that it's different to the original pacman package manager.  At the command line you only have to type <code>pacman</code> because this has been set up as a BASH alias.</p>

    <h3>Tidy your pacman-g2 cache (oh, and your mother said "Tidy your room")</h3>
    <p>When pacman-g2 downloads a package (*.fpm) it's copied to pacman's cache folder - /var/cache/pacman-g2/pkg by default.  The more packages you ask pacman-g2 to download, the more disk space is used because downloaded package files are not automatically deleted.  Instead you need to tidy up pacman-g2's cache and there are two options available to help.</p>
    <p>The command <code>pacman-g2 -Sc</code> will delete package files where a greater version of the package is already in the cache folder.  As an example - if the files kdebase-3.5.9-1.fpm and kdebase-3.5.9-2.fpm are in the cache folder, kdebase-3.5.9-1.fpm will be deleted.  You will be prompted to confirm the package deletions (unless you use the "--noconfirm" switch).</p>
    <p>The command <code>pacman-g2 -Scc</code> will delete <em>all</em> package files in the cache folder.  Take notice that this command has <em>TWO</em> 'c's.  You will be prompted to confirm the package deletions (unless you use the "--noconfirm" switch).</p>


<a name="tips"><h2>Tips and tricks</h2></a>

    <p><b>Disclaimer</b> - Be aware that the hints &amp; tips provided here have NOT been tested and so come with no warranty.</p>

    <p>Each of the following tips are for Midnight Commander, a text-based file manager.  Even if you usually use a GUI file manager, having MC available is useful in those situations when working with a CLI is faster, or perhaps X isn't working (<em>sigh</em>).</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <h3>"Transparent" mode</h3>

        <p>Imagine the scene - you've spent months tweaking your desktop until it looks better than Halle Berry, including a transparent terminal.  (OK, I know nothing can quite compare, but please read on...).  You want to do some file management and, because it's so light on resources, you run Midnight Commander (MC).  Ugh!  MC appears in all its ugly colours, making your transparent terminal look ugly.  The answer is to use the "-b" switch, which makes MC appear with white text on a black background.</p>
    </li>
   <li>
        <h3>Daah, dah dah dah dah dah dah, dah dah...It's <em>EDIT</em> Time</h3>
        <p>The title of this hint is to be sung to the tune "U Can't Touch This" by MC Hammer.  If you didn't sing along, please go back and try singing it this time.  If you don't know the tune, don't Google for it because the song really wasn't that good.  The man certainly had some fancy pants, though. :)  If you're not already lost in my gibberish, here's the MC tip.</p>
        <p>MC has a built-in editor which can also be used as a standalone editor.  The command <code>mcedit</code> is a symlink to the MC executable and launches the editor.  While it's not vim nor emacs (thank goodness), it has many features - including syntax highlighting.  For information on features and keybindings, refer to <a href="http://www.ibiblio.org/mc/">MC's home page</a>.  <em>Note:</em> vim and emacs fans can send their feedback to get_a_better_editor [AT] mc.rocks.org</p>

    <p>This section relies on your contributions! If have some tips and tricks that you would like to be shown in the newsletter, <em>please</em> post them on the forums.</p>
