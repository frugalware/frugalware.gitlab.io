  "left">Events</h2>

  <p>Here's a selection of events which have occurred since the previous
  newsletter:</p>

  <h3>Frugalware 1.3's code-name is announced</h3>

  <p>On 17 March 2010, VMiklos announced the codename for the next Frugalware
  release, 1.3 - "Haven". For those that don't already know, all code-names are
  from a series of fictional planets which feature in Isaac Asimov's
  "Foundation" series of science fiction novels.</p>

  <p>Plans for "Haven" haven't yet been finalised but as anyone who subscribes
  to the git commits mailing list will know, there has already been a lot of
  activity since 1.2 was released. The biggest change so far has been a kernel
  upgrade to 2.6.33. This kernel introduces the "nouveau" driver, which is an
  open source driver for Nvidia graphics chipsets. The implementation of this
  change has caused issues for some Nvidia users so <strong>please</strong>
  read <a href="http://frugalware.org/news/165">this message</a> from
  Frugalware developer Hermier before upgrading to the latest kernel.</p>

  <h3>New FrugalBuild contributors</h3>

  <p>Frugalware users Adrien Ramos and kikadf recently submitted several
  FrugalBuilds for new packages. Each of these is either undergoing review or
  has been accepted. Many thanks to these two and we hope they have a bright
  future in packaging.</p>

  <h3>Forums are back!</h3>

  <p>Several weeks ago, the server which hosted the Frugalware forums had a
  hard drive fail. Unfortunately the hard drive was not part of a RAID array,
  so the problem could only be solved by replacing the failed drive and
  restoring the forums' data from backup (which are done regularly). Thanks to
  VMiklos and any others involved, the forums were back online on 12 March
  2010. The server's hard drive configuration has since been upgraded to a RAID
  array, so the chance of the same problem happening again is very low.</p>

  <h3>New screenshots for 1.2</h3>

  <p>Frugalware user bviktor recently submitted some screenshots of Locris'
  installer and GUI desktop, so that the web site could be current. Frugalware
  developer Devil505 then added captions and uploaded them to the <a href=
  "http://frugalware.org/screenshots">screenshots</a> page. Many thanks to
  bviktor for submitting the screenshots. If you ever find something on the web
  site which is not current, or is simply wrong, please report it via a bug
  report and we will fix it as soon aras we can.</p>

  <h3>New mirror</h3>

  <p>Thanks to the generosity of the University of Crete, we have a new mirror.
  One of the existing mirrors - FTP6 (located in the USA) has not been
  available for some time. That domain name has been reused for the mirror in
  Greece so FTP6 will again be a current mirror. The news gets even better
  because the old FTP6 mirror had 100 MBit bandwidth but the new one has 1
  GBit bandwidth!</p>

  <p>VMiklos checked the <a href="http://frugalware.org/~vmiklos/stats/mirmon/">
  statistics</a> of all Frugalware mirrors and confirmed that nine
  are working, with only two broken. Hopefully we can replace the two which are
  broken, so that soon all mirrors are up to date. In some countries local
  folklore says that a broken mirror brings you seven years of bad luck but
  thankfully this doesn't apply to Internet mirrors. If it did, we would be in a
  lot of trouble!</p>

  <h2><img src="http://frugalware.org/images/newsletter/community.png" align=
  "left">Frugalware's users are people too!</h2>

  <p>This is the latest in the ongoing series of interviews with Frugalware's
  users. Even though we have at least one thing in common - our use of
  Frugalware - everyone has a different, interesting story to tell. The user
  featured in this issue has the most incredible answer to the interview
  question - "What do you do when you're not using Frugalware?" Please read

  <h2><img src="http://frugalware.org/images/newsletter/community.png" align=
  "left">FLOSS developers are people too!</h2>

  <p>Without developers, we wouldn't have the Linux kernel and all the software
  that we run on the platform. What motivates FLOSS developers? Why does anyone
  choose to spend their time writing software when they don't get paid to do
  so? What do developers do when they're not writing software? These questions
  and more are the inspiration behind this section of the newsletter. Many
  thanks to all the developers who have agreed to this interview.</p>

  <p>Interviews with the following FLOSS developers are planned for the near
  future:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Jesse van den Kieboom - gedit developer;</li>

    <li>David Siegel - Gnome Do developer;</li>

    <li>Marc - jBrout developer.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>This issue, we have an interview with Mitchell Foral.</p>

  <dl>
    <dt><strong>What's your name?</strong></dt>

    <dd>
      <p>Mitchell Foral</p>
    </dd>

    <dt><strong>What FLOSS projects are you involved in?</strong></dt>

    <dd>
      <p>I am actively involved in Textadept (http://caladbolg.net/textadept),
      my programmer's text editor and its editing component Scintillua
      (http://scintillua.googlecode.com), a fork of Scintilla. Over the years I
      have also started a number of projects on my own (gcocoadialog,
      SciTE-tools, ...) and contributed to others (Ohcount, SciTE, ...).</p>
    </dd>

    <dt><strong>What led to you being a FLOSS
    developer/contributor?</strong></dt>

    <dd>
      <p>I like the idea of writing software for myself, and then giving it
      away to anyone else who might find it useful. Often the users provide me
      with bugs, feedback, and/or suggestions. This in turn results in a better
      piece of software, while I have learned something new and can be a better
      programmer because of it.</p>
    </dd>

    <dt><strong>What do you like about being a FLOSS
    developer/contributor?</strong></dt>

    <dd>
      <p>Programming is a form of expression. I can freely express myself
      without having to worry about a boss, deadlines, or distractions that you
      would typically find in a workplace environment. I also like the
      challenge of solving problems with code. Of course, the feeling I get
      when someone else contacts me saying how useful my code is for them is
      amazing. You would be hard-pressed to find a hobby more gratifying!</p>
    </dd>

    <dt><strong>What don't you like about being a FLOSS
    developer/contributor?</strong></dt>

    <dd>
      <p>There is only one thing: rejecting feature requests. I do not want to
      sound disrespectful to anyone's personal preference as to how a piece of
      software should be.</p>
    </dd>

    <dt><strong>What do you do outside the FLOSS world?</strong></dt>

    <dd>
      <p>I am a juggler and a student finishing my undergraduate degrees in
      Engineering and Physics.</p>
    </dd>

    <dt><strong>What operating system(s) do you use and why?</strong></dt>

    <dd>
      <p>I love the idea of open-source, so Linux is naturally the way to go. I
      use Archlinux because of its lightweight nature. I also find Linux very
      programmer-friendly and have a cross-compiling setup so I do not have to
      work in Windows.</p>
    </dd>

    <dt><strong>If people are interested in helping your project(s), how might
    they do this?</strong></dt>

    <dd>
      <p>They can submit bugs, suggestions, and/or feedback via the trackers,
      mailing lists, and IRC channels for my projects as appropriate. My direct
      contact information is also listed in source code.</p>

  <p><b>Disclaimer</b> - Be aware that the hints &amp; tips provided here have
  NOT been tested and so come with no warranty.</p>

  <h3>Documentation on your PC</h3>

  <p>When all other options fail, even a geek sometimes has to RTFM. Today we
  usually do a search or visit the project's home page when looking for help.
  Keep in mind, though, that there is a lot of documentation already on your PC.
  Any documentation that an application includes in its source code package is
  included in the matching Frugalware package and installed in
  /usr/share/doc/<package name>. Command-line utilities such as sed and grep
  also have extensive help available via their man(ual) pages. Sometimes there
  is a need to include Frugalware-specific notes for a package, and so a file
  named "README.Frugalware" is included in the package. Look out for these when
  you are browsing for documentation.</p>

  <p>When someone next tells you to RTFM (and that's Read The <strong>Fine
  </strong> Manual! :P), you will have no excuse because it's right there on
  your PC.</p>

  <p>This section relies on your contributions! If you have some tips and
  tricks that you would like to be shown in the newsletter, <em>please</em>
  post them on the forums.</p>

  <h3>Mirage</h3>

  <p><a href="http://mirageiv.berlios.de/">Mirage</a> is a lightweight,
  easy-to-use image viewer written in Python and GTK. Because it has only a few
  dependencies, it is suitable for any desktop, whether you use a desktop
  environment or not. Its user interface is very simple, with thumbnails of all
  loaded images in a pane on the left of the window and the currently focused
  image to the right. As well as standard image viewer features, it also offers
  a slideshow function and many common editing options including rotation,
  resizing and cropping. The beauty of Mirage is that it focuses on one
  purpose, being an image viewer, and nothing else. Even if you currently use
  another image viewer, please try Mirage because you might like it better.</p>
