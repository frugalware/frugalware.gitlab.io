<a name="events"><h2>Events</h2></a>
<p>
    Here's a selection of events which have occurred since the previous newsletter:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <h3>Speed record attempt</h3>
        <p>James Buren (ryuo) and Janos Kovacs (janny) recently tried to break the record for the fastest bug report resolution.  At 13:48 on 28 July 2008, ryuo reported a bug with The Gimp's package.  At 15:09 on the same day, janny had submitted the corrected Frugalbuild.  Well done to ryuo and janny.  Of course we now expect all bug reports to be fixed this quickly.  :)</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h3>Frugalware wallpaper announcement</h3>
        <p>For the very first time in Frugalware's history we're running a competition to select a wallpaper for release 0.9 - codenamed "Solaria".  Please read all about the competition <a href="http://www.frugalware.org/news/105">here</a>.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h3>Frugalware 0.9 - Solaria - release candidate schedule change</h3>
        <p>The scheduled dates for 0.9's release candidates - 1 and 2 - have been changed to a week later to allow more time for user testing.  If you have the required time and bandwidth available, <em>PLEASE</em> test the release candidates once they become available.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h3>Elentir has begun work on a GUI installer</h3>
        <p>User 'Elentir' has begun work on a GUI installer for Frugalware with VMiklos' consent.  While a GUI installer is not strictly required, it is attractive to some people.  If it is successful then it may be adopted as a official Frugalware project.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h3>gholafox's work improves</h3>
        <p>gholafox recently had two new packages' Frugalbuilds accepted into the official repositories.  These were for nitrogen - a wallpaper browser and selection tool - and Openstromenace - a 3D space shooting game.  gholafox's work is getting better with each Frugalbuild.  Perhaps he'll join the development team, gaining the fame, glory and fortune that brings.  :P</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h3>New contributor - Elentir</h3>
        <p>As well as working on a GUI installer, Elentir has also been submitting Frugalbuilds.  He/she recently submitted a Frugalbuild for valkyrie - a Qt GUI for Valgrind Tools - with help from VMiklos.  If you "see" Elentir in IRC or anywhere else, please encourage his/her work.  We need all the developers we can get.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h3>Logging in as user "root"</h3>
        <p>In the forums recently (23 July 08), richard raised in the forums the question of logging in as the 'root' user.  The short answer was "DON"T DO IT!"  For more details as to why this is a bad idea, read the <a href="http://forums.frugalware.org/index.php?t=msg&th=1596&start=0&rid=0">forum thread</a>.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h3>New donation</h3>
        <p>Marius Cirsta recently donated some money to the Frugalware project.  Many thanks to him.  This brings VMiklos one small step closer to his dream of owning a Ferrari.  Seriously, any money donated to the project goes directly to meet the project's costs - domain names, hardware upgrades etc.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h3>LGee takes on a new role</h3>
        <p>LGee recently volunteered to help with tidying the Bug Tracker System (BTS).  His role is to review bug reports which haven't been assigned and assign them to a developer.  His help is very welcome because, while it's not exciting work, it's important to Frugalware's progress.</p>

        <h3>Envy Code R monospace font</h3>
        <p>Let's be honest - we all like an attractive monospace font.  <a href="http://damieng.com/">Envy Code R</a> is a "free" TrueType monospace font.  The author has spent quite some time working on this font, including tweaking it to suits Windows' ClearType technology.  While it's not quite as clear under X as it is under Windows, the results are still impressive.  While there are other, clear monospace fonts, they're mostly bitmap fonts and so not scalable.  Envy Code R however, scales very well, with the font quite clear even in quite a small size.  Take a look at Envy Code R - you might like it.  Note that it's still under "development" but it's perfect for my requirements as it is now.</p>

<a name="packages"><h2>Focus On Package(s)</h2></a>

    <h3>rxvt-unicode (again) :)</h3>
        <p>rxvt-unicode was mentioned in newsletter issue 24 as being a useful, light terminal emulator.  One interesting feature was not mentioned in that issue is its ability to use Perl extensions to provide additional functions and features.  One such feature is that of tabs - like Konsole, Terminal, Sakura et al.  To use this feature, use the flag "-pe tabbed".  Once it's enabled you use [Shift] and [Down arrow] to create a new tab and [Shift] and [Left arrow] or [Right arrow] to switch between the tabs.  rxvt-unicode's tabbed feature doesn't look as nice as that of mrxvt but it's just as useful.</p>


<a name="fixes"><h2>Bug fixes</h2></a>

    <p>The following table gives you a overview of activity on bugs and feature requests as at 19 July 2008.  In each cell of the table is a link to a detailed list of the relevant bugs or feature requests.</p>

<a name="security"><h2>Security announcements</h2></a>

    <p><b>Remember</b> - According to the normal support arrangements for Frugalware, the release of 0.8 ("Kalgan") means that support for the previous release has ended.  This means that no further security or bug fixes will be released for Frugalware 0.7 ("Sayshell").</p>

    <p>Here is a list of <a href="/security">security issues</a> which have been discovered and fixed in the 0.8 release since the previous newsletter.</p>
