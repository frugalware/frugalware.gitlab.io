<h2>Events</h2>
<p>
    Here's a selection of events which have occurred since the previous newsletter:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <h3>Frugalware newsletter issue 21, where are you?</h3>
        <p>The Frugalware newsletter is produced in a secure facility, to prevent its theft from the newsletter writers of rival distributions. Unfortunately the facility was broken into recently and newsletter issue 21 was <b>STOLEN</b>.  I apologise for the absence of this issue but it was not able to be recovered from the thieves.  No note was left behind and there has not been any contact, regarding a ransom for example.</p>
        <p>If this all sounds too crazy, the truth is that I <b>accidentally</b> gave the last issue the number 22, where it should have been 21.  Oh well, things that like happen sometimes.  Maybe no-one noticed issue 21 being missing and I shouldn't have mentioned it.  :)</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h3>New packagers are making progress</h3>
        <p>jedifox and Flaker Oats are two relative noobies to packaging for Frugalware.  Both have been submitting Frugalbuilds via the Frugalware developers mailing list and getting great feedback.  If you "see them", please encourage their efforts because new packagers are always welcome.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h3>Krix is back!</h3>
        <p>On 9 April 2008, krix announced that he's back and had begun working on packaging gnome 2.22.  We're not quite sure where he'd been but hope it was warm and sunny.  Perhaps some holiday photos will be appearing soon?</p>
    </li>
</ul>


<a name="interview"></a>
    <h2>Frugalware's developers are people too!</h2>
        <p>In this feature of the newsletter, Frugalware's developers reveal a little about themselves.  The aim is to show that "Frugalware's developers are people too!"  I thank the developers for taking the time to answer the questions.  There will be one interview per newsletter (until we run out of developers).</p>

    <h3>bouleetbil</h3>
        <p>This issue's interview is with bouleetbil, whose roles in the Frugalware development team include maintaining various packages.  Please stand and hum the French national anthem while you read his interview.</p>

    <dt><b>What's your name?</b></dt>
        <dd>GaÃ«tan Gourdin</dd>
    <dt><b>What's your IRC nickname?</b></dt>
        <dd>Bouleetbil (From French comics for children)</dd>
    <dt><b>In what country do you live?</b></dt>
        <dd>France (Montpellier)</dd>
    <dt><b>In what country were you born?</b></dt>
        <dd>France (Dreux)</dd>
    <dt><b>What do you like the most about where you live?</b></dt>
        <dd>I live in a sunny region, thus I like to eat outside, also enjoy a glass of pink wine on my terrace... but not everyday :-)  Since I've had a daughter, I like to participate in her school activities.</dd>
    <dt><b>What do you do for the Frugalware project?</b></dt>
        <dd>I'm a package maintainer. I just began participating in this project and it's very interesting.</dd>
    <dt><b>What motivates you to work on Frugalware?</b></dt>
        <dd>I had used Gentoo for several years, then I began looking for a binary distribution. I found Frugalware and was impressed by it. I've tested it for 1 month. Devil505 helped me to write FrugalBuilds for some packages that I wanted to use. Afterward he encouraged me to send them to the Frugalware mailing list. At this time, I spoke with vmiklos and crazy. They also spent time explaining to me some things; it is also thanks to them that I wanted to work for Frugalware. Also, the community is always ready to help, such as jedifox :-)). All the developers and the community are really nice and I really wanted to participate in an open source project. For all these reasons I'm working now for Frugalware.</dd>
    <dt><b>What do you do when you're not working on Frugalware?</b></dt>
        <dd>I'm a developer for a company which creates software for nurses (not open source). During my spare time, if I'm not working on Frugalware, I have a break in my garden, or eat with friends or my family. I also like to walk and visit some new places.</dd>
    <dt><b>What's the view from your front door?</b></dt>
        <dd>A little house.  Open the door and <a href="http://frugalware.org/images/interviews/bouleetbil.jpg">have a look.</a></dd>

    <li>
        <h3>How to mount an ISO image - submitted by 'phayz'</h3>
        <p>It's often worth checking that what's contained in an ISO image is what you expect. Before burning an ISO image to media, you can mount it and check its contents. To mount it, use the following command as root, where ISOIMAGE is the ISO to be mounted, and MOUNT_POINT is the point in the directory where the ISO image is to be mounted.</p>
        <p><pre>mount -o loop ISOIMAGE.iso MOUNT_POINT</pre></p>
        <p>With the ISO image mounted, you can browse its contents just as if you had the media mounted in a drive.</p>

<a name="packages"</a>
<h2>Focus On Package(s)</h2>

    <h3>Xeyes</h3>
    <p>The package for this issue of the newsletter is a "once-in-a-lifetime".  That's a nice way of saying that after running it once, you probably won't ever run it again. :)  Xeyes puts in the middle of your screen a pair of eyes, the pupils of which "follow" the mouse's pointer as you move it around the screen.  Try it, at least once, but be warned if you're inclined to be paranoid, because the eyes really <b>ARE</b> watching you!</p>


<a name="fixes"></a>
