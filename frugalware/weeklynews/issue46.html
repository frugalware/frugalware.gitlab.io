  <h2>Frugalware Linux Newsletter - Issue 45</h2>

  <h2>...to inform...to educate...to entertain</h2>

  <p>"IRC is just multiplayer notepad."&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>A geek</em></p>

  <h2>Welcome</h2>

  <p>The newsletter's aim is to keep you up to date with what's happened
  recently in the world of the Linux distribution 'Frugalware'.</p>

  <p>Features of this issue include:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>X.org 7.4 and kernel 2.6.30 upgrades</li>

    <li>Xfce 4.6.1 is available in current</li>

    <li>Priyank's got a new baby!</li>

    <li>Frugalware's developers are people too - Cedynamix</li>

    <li>Getting To Know You - pacman-g2's "--ask" parameter</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Events</h2>

  <p>Here's a selection of events which have occurred since the previous
  newsletter:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <h3>X.org 7.4</h3>

      <p>X.org has been upgraded to the very latest version - 7.4 - in the
      current repository. This release of X was more modular than the previous
      version so many packages had to be rebuilt. Tests by those development
      team members involved in the upgrade have all passed. Be aware though,
      that there could be packages in the current repository which have been
      broken by the upgrade. If you want to avoid problems, you might want to
      wait at least a few days before applying any upgrades from the current
      repository. Thanks to everybody involved in this upgrade.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <h3>Kernel 2.6.30</h3>

      <p>The X.org upgrade required an upgrade to the kernel, so the Linux
      kernel in the current repositories has also been upgraded - to version
      2.6.30.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <h3>Xfce 4.6.1 is available in current</h3>

      <p>Priyank has packaged Xfce 4.6.1 and its various applications and
      plugins and it's now available in the current repository. Thanks to
      Priyank for his hard work. Changes since Xfce 4.4 include:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>xfce-mcs-manager and xfce-mcs plugins are replaced by
        xfce4-settings</li>

        <li>libxfce4mcs is replaced by xfconf</li>

        <li>gfpm-mcs-plugin is now xfce4-gfpm-plugin</li>

        <li>gnetconfig-mcs-plugin is now xfce4-gnetconfig-plugin</li>

        <li>New package(s): xfce4-power-manager and gigolo (tool for mounting
        remote filesystems)</li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li>
      <h3>10 + 10 = ?</h3>

      <p>If your first thought was - "Are those numbers in the decimal, hex or
      binary numbering system?", well done - you passed this exam. Seriously,
      though, Voroskoi recently announced that he's preparing for exams and so
      can't devote much time to Frugalware until they're complete. To Voroskoi
      and anyone else who's preparing for exams - good luck.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <h3>Priyank's got a new baby!</h3>

      <p>Priyank, if you're reading this, it isn't what you think. :) He's
      recently been busy creating a GFpm plugin for both Nautilus (the default
      file manager of the Gnome desktop) and Thunar (the default file manager of the
      Xfce desktop). The plugin allows you to view the properties of a
      pacman-g2 package (fpm file) simply by right-clicking on the file and
      selecting "Properties" from the context menu. Thanks, Priyank, for adding
      such a useful feature to these file managers.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <h3>An improved newsletter</h3>

      <p>I have recently been working to improve the newsletter, mainly
      correcting spelling errors and improving its validity. These are each
      small improvements but I believe they improve the quality of the
      newsletter. Each newsletter issue goes through 5 checks before it's
      released. Unfortunately the fifth check was added only recently, and
      that's the spelling check. :( I'm embarrassed when I find spelling errors
      in past newsletters, but everyone makes mistakes. My goal is to find
      these mistakes before they're published. Regarding the HTML validity of
      the newsletter itself, there's quite a lot of work to do there. They
      won't happen overnight but I hope to have these improvements made
      soon.</p>
    </li>

  <h2>Frugalware's developers are people too</h2>

  <p>Here is the latest in the series of interviews with Frugalware's
  developers.</p>

  <dl>
    <dt><strong>What's your name?</strong></dt>

    <dd>
      <p>I'm CÃ©drick Hannier, 32 years old, and am responsible for
      a workshop in the automotive sector.</p>
    </dd>

    <dt><strong>What's your IRC nickname?</strong></dt>

    <dd>
      <p>Cedynamix</p>
    </dd>

    <dt><strong>In what country do you live?</strong></dt>

    <dd>
      <p>I live in France near Angers.</p>
    </dd>

    <dt><strong>In what country were you born?</strong></dt>

    <dd>
      <p>I was born in Cherbourg, in the region of Normandy, France.</p>
    </dd>

    <dt><strong>What do you like the most about where you live (the country
    and/or town/city)?</strong></dt>

    <dd>
      <p>Tranquillity, wine and weather is always pleasant in every season.</p>
    </dd>

    <dt><strong>What do you do for the Frugalware project?</strong></dt>

    <dd>
      <p>I am a package maintainer. I'm currently testing the integration of
      notify-osd in FW. Otherwise I also do some graphics - I created 2
      wallpapers (a little too late for the release of Anacreon) and right now
      I'm working on a theme for Gnome and a new wallpaper.</p>
    </dd>

    <dt><strong>What motivates you to work on Frugalware?</strong></dt>

    <dd>
      <p>The passion simply. I have had a computer since I was 13 years. I
      switched to Linux 5 years ago with a distro that likes the color brown.
      And then I discovered the universe that surrounds FW 8 months ago. I
      loved the community, the philosophy and the ability to be able to
      contribute to the improvement and evolution of the distribution.</p>
    </dd>

    <dt><strong>What do you do when you're not working on
    Frugalware?</strong></dt>

    <dd>
      <p>I look after my family. I tinker a lot inside and outside my
      house.</p>
    </dd>

    <dt><strong>What's the view from your front door?</strong></dt>

    <dd>
      <p>Editor's comment: Cedynamix provided two photos but since they're
      equally nice I decided to include both.</p>

  <h2>Getting To Know You</h2>

  <p>In this section of the newsletter, we get to know Frugalware Linux a
  little at a time. This is not meant to replace the official documentation but
  instead make it easier to read. This should suit those those people who, like
  me, have short attention spans. :)</p>

  <h3>pacman-g2's "--ask" parameter</h3>

  <p>pacman-g2 will ask you questions under certain circumstances - e.g. a
  package's file is corrupt, the local version is already up to date, and so
  on. These questions are necessary to ensure that pacman-g2 does what you want
  it to do. If you always give the same response to the same question, it can
  get annoying to answer every time. To resolve this problem, pacman-g2 has an
  "--ask" switch. If you want pacman-g2 to avoid installing packages which are
  already up to date, you would use the command "pacman-g2 -S --ask 32
  &lt;package&gt;". The number '32' means - if any packages are already up to
  date, don't install them. Refer to pacman-g2's man page for full details of
  the "--ask" parameter.</p>

  <h2>Tips and tricks</h2>

  <p><b>Disclaimer</b> - Be aware that the tips &amp; tricks provided here have
  NOT been tested and so come with no warranty.</p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <h3>Keep your work under version control</h3>

      <p>Version control systems such as CVS, Subversion, Bazaar and git were
      developed to make it easier to manage the many changes that are made
      during software development. They can also be used to manage changes to
      other files - e.g. config files, documents. Instead of constantly using
      the "Save as" function and keeping files named "file1.odf",
      "file1-backup1.odf", "file1-backup2.odf" and so on, you commit the
      file(s) each time you change them. There are several advantages to this
      method, including -</p>

      <ul>
        <li>you can tag each modification with a description (i.e. a commit
        message) that's as long as you like. This makes it easier to identify
        each version, instead of having to maintain a separate list of each
        file's version;</li>

        <li>systems such as Bazaar and git store only the differences between
        committed files, so they're much more space efficient than the "Save
        as" method;</li>

        <li>you can schedule commits, with a utility such as 'cron', so that
        you can be sure changes are committed, even if you forget.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li>
      <h3>"C shell run. Run, shell, run."</h3>

      <p>There are many shells available to Linux users - including BASH, zsh,
      csh - and they each have their own scripting language. When you start a
      terminal emulator, you're also starting an instance of your default shell
      and every command you type is handled by the shell. If you run a script,
      though, it doesn't have to be written in the language of your default
      shell. If you find a useful script written in zsh for example, you can
      run it even though your default shell is BASH. If the first line of a
      script is "#!/bin/sh" then it will assume the script is to be run by your
      default shell. Otherwise the first line must specify the shell to be used
      - e.g. "#!/bin/zsh".</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <h3>Read some blogs</h3>

      <p>Frugalware's developers each have their own blogs but their content is
      gathered together in one place - <a href=
      "http://planet.frugalware.org/">http://planet.frugalware.org/</a>. These
      blogs are not too busy, so it's quite easy to keep up with their content.
      There's some quite interesting content, including some hints and tips, so
      be sure to take a look.</p>

      <p>Many of the French-language Frugalware community also have their own
      blogs, including Devil505 and Bouleetbil. They're very active in blogging
      and there's some great content. The site <a href=
      "http://planet.frugalware-fr.org/">http://planet.frugalware-fr.org/</a>
      gathers together various blogs' content and presents it at one site. Of
      course these blogs are in the French language, but with the help of
      Google's translator, you should still be able to read them.</p>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>This section relies on your contributions! If you have some tips and tricks
  that you would like to be shown in the newsletter, <em>please</em> post them
  on the forums.</p>

  <h2>Focus On Package(s)</h2>

  <h3>ObTheme</h3>

  <p>"<a href="http://xyne.archlinux.ca/info/obtheme">ObTheme</a> is a GUI
  theme editor for openbox. Among its features are a live preview mode, a
  built-in xbm image button editor and a palette for changing colors globally."
  OpenBox is a window manager, and in keeping with the Unix philosophy of "each
  application does a specific job and does it well", that's all it does.
  OpenBox's themes mainly use colours, with bitmaps (XBMs) used only to
  decorate toolbar buttons. ObTheme is a recent addition to Frugalware, thanks
  to jercel. If you use OpenBox, try ObTheme and you'll soon have your desktop
  looking just as you like it.</p>
