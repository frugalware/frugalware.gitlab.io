  of different places, just write a Unix operating
  system."&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>Linus Torvalds</em></p>

  <h2>Welcome</h2>

  <p>The newsletter's aim is to keep you up to date with what's happened
  recently in the world of the Linux distribution 'Frugalware'.</p>

  <p>Features of this issue include:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>"Frugalware's Gonna Git Ya"</li>

    <li>Frugalware's artists are people too - WebEagle</li>

    <li>FLOSS developers are people too - Ali Abdallah</li>

    <li>Got a problem? Ask your teddy bear!</li>

    <li>Focus On Package(s) - Droid fonts set</li>
  </ul>

  <p><strong>NOTE:</strong> There is no "Getting To Know You" section in this
  issue. I am not sure when this section will return, or if in fact it will
  return. For the moment, I have explained all that I think is suitable for the
  newsletter. If you would like to see this series continue, please post a
  message in the forum.</p>

  <h2><img src="http://frugalware.org/images/newsletter/event.png" align=
  "left">Events</h2>

  <p>Here's a selection of events which have occurred since the previous
  newsletter:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <h3>Frugalware 1.2pre2 has been released</h3>

      <p>On 22 February 2010, VMiklos announced the release of Frugalware 1.2
      pre2. This is the second in the series of pre-releases for 1.2 - codename
      'Locris'. It already features some significant improvements over 1.1,
      including:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Linux kernel 2.6.32.8</li>

        <li>OpenOffice.org 3.2.0</li>

        <li>KDE 4.3.5</li>

        <li>Mozilla Firefox 3.6</li>

        <li>Thunderbird 3.0.1</li>
      </ul>

      <p>As with every release, if you have the required bandwidth and time
      available, <em>please</em> download and test this release. The more bugs
      that are found now, the better quality will be the final release. If you
      want to know the schedule for 1.2, refer to the <a href=
      "http://frugalware.org/roadmap">roadmap</a> page.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <h3>Curses! It's pacman-g2!</h3>

      <p>Frugalware developer ryuo is considering writing an ncurses-based
      interface to pacman-g2. For those that don't know, ncurses interfaces
      have many of the features of GUI interfaces: windows, checkboxes, radio
      buttons etc, but these are in a terminal. The aim would be to produce an
      application which made it easier to manage packages, for those who don't
      run XWindows or don't like GUIs. If you are interested in this being
      developed, please mention in the forum. Please understand that ryuo is
      seeking votes for or against this idea. Even if there are many votes of
      "Yes", there is no guarantee that it will be developed.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <h3>Fwife 0.6 released</h3>

      <p>On his blog, Frugalware developer Elentir <a href=
      "http://elentir.toile-libre.org/?page_id=102">announced</a> the release
      of Fwife 0.6, a GUI installer for Frugalware. Since starting on the
      project about 12 months ago, Elentir has made great progress. So that
      users can test this release, he has created ISOs for both i686 and x86_64
      architectures. You don't have to use a physical PC to do the testing,
      since you can use software like QEMU and VirtualBox to create a virtual
      environment. If you have some time available, <em>please</em> do help
      because it's best if Fwife is tested on as many PC hardware combinations
      as possible.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <h3>Beautiful Bisigi</h3>

      <p>The <a href="http://www.bisigi-project.org/?lang=en">Bisigi</a>
      project has been mentioned in the newsletter before, and its aim is to
      produce attractive, consistent themes for the GNOME desktop. They were
      created primarily for Ubuntu, but they look equally good on a Frugalware
      desktop (providing logos are changed :) ). Devil505 recently adapted them
      for Frugalware and packaged them for installation via pacman-g2. If you
      are running GNOME and/or GTK-based applications, try the Bisigi themes
      because they are quite beautiful.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <h3>"And the award for the best book goes to..."</h3>

      <p>I recently downloaded and began reading the "<a href=
      "http://book.git-scm.com">Git community book</a>", which was created from
      content submitted by the community of Git's users. In the first few pages
      is a list of people thanked for their help with the book. I was excited
      and surprised to see, amongst names such as Linus Torvald, the name
      Miklos Vajna. Whatever you did for the book, well done VMiklos! Now I
      need to read the rest...</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <h3>"Frugalware's Gonna Git Ya"</h3>

      <p>Amongst the Frugalware team are several talented musicians and to
      celebrate Frugalware's 5th birthday, they have collaborated in making a
      CD titled "Frugalware's Gonna Git Ya". The team's goal was to create an
      emotional tribute to the Linux distribution that they work so hard to
      maintain and improve. Every song was chosen because its title meant
      something to its author. Although the song titles themselves are of very
      popular songs (in some part of the world), the lyrics are entirely
      original. WebEagle provided the use of his home studio for the entire
      process of recording, mixing, editing and mastering of each track.</p>

      <p>So far public reviews have been very positive, with the reviewer in
      Stone Rolling magazine quoted as saying "Every track on the CD made me so
      emotional that I had to leave the room and couldn't return for a long
      time." All tracks are available under a Creative Commons, Share-alike
      licence, so please download them and share them with your friends and
      family. A new album is already planned, with the working title
      "Frugalware's Greatest Hits".</p>

      <dl>
        <dt><strong>"Honey Honey" (Original artist - ABBA)</strong></dt>

        <dd>
          <p>This song is dedicated to that amazing creature - the honey bee.
          This amazing creature collects pollen from flowers and in turn
          produces a very nutritious food. On this track Carl Anderson (AKA
          beecarl) gives an emotional performance about the honey bee and what
          this creature means to him.</p>
        </dd>

        <dt><strong>C'Mon Wit Da Git Down (Original artist -
        Artifacts)</strong></dt>

        <dd>
          <p>Frugalware has used the git version control system for several
          years now. Its features have allowed us to focus on our goals,
          instead of having to worry about the version control system itself.
          The title of this song could be translated to "If you want to join
          the development team, first download git." All of Frugalware's
          development team sing on this track, since they all use and love
          git.</p>
        </dd>

        <dt><strong>Git Bizzy (Original artist - Big Daddy Kane)</strong></dt>

        <dd>
          <p>In this song we are all encouraged to use git in our daily lives,
          or "git bizzy", as the title says. Crazy sings the lead vocals on
          this track. If you listen closely, you may be able to hear some of
          Crazy's actual commit messages amongst the lyrics.</p>
        </dd>

        <dt><strong>I Want You Back (Original artist - The Jackson
        5)</strong></dt>

        <dd>
          <p>This song is for everyone who has ever cried after accidentally
          deleting an important file/partition. At the moment you clicked the
          mouse button, or pressed the wrong key, you experience many emotions,
          including rage, regret and sorrow. Don't be surprised if you find a
          few tears come to your eyes as you listen to this track. The entire
          development team sings, since everyone has been affected by this
          tragedy at some time in their lives.</p>
        </dd>

        <dt><strong>If You Don't Know Me By Now (Original artist - Simply
        Red)</strong></dt>

        <dd>
          <p>Let's be honest - geeks don't like to read documentation. Instead
          they will try everything, before they finally give in and read the
          manual. The full title of this track is "If You Don't Know Me By Now,
          RTFM" but censorship rules required that the "RTFM" be removed from
          the title. VMiklos is the lead singer on this track, with other
          developers humming along.</p>
        </dd>

        <dt><strong>"We Are The World" (Original artist -
        Various)</strong></dt>

        <dd>
          <p>Frugalware developers, contributors and artists live in many
          countries. Cooperating in developing and improving Frugalware is a
          great example of people making the world a better place. Each member
          of the team takes a turn to sing part of this song, with everyone
          singing on the chorus.</p>
        </dd>

        <dt><strong>Pacman (original artist - Weird Al Yankovich)</strong></dt>

        <dd>
          <p>Pacman(-g2) is such an important part of Frugalware that it simply
          <strong>had</strong> to have an entire track dedicated to it. VMiklos
          gives an incredible, emotional performance.</p>
        </dd>

        <dt><strong>Jump (original artist - Van Halen)</strong></dt>

        <dd>
          <p>On this track WebEagle sings about his career, which has involved
          a lot of jumping out planes (with a parachute attached). In the time
          between jumping out of the plane and landing on the ground, he plans
          new artwork for Frugalware. If he is at work in the office and his
          boss says "Jump", WebEagle's only question is "From how high?"</p>
        </dd>

        <dt><strong>Secure Yourself (original artist - Indigo
        Girls)</strong></dt>

        <dd>
          <p>In the modern world of technology, there are threats all around
          us. To help every Frugalware user improve the security of their PC or
          server, voroskoi sings about security hints and tips.</p>

  <h2><img src="http://frugalware.org/images/newsletter/community.png" align=
  "left">Frugalware's artists are people too</h2>

  <p>This is the latest series of interviews with members of the Frugalware
  artwork team. Their role is to create artwork which can be used various
  aspects of Frugalware to make it look good. It's not as easy as it sounds,
  with monitors of different dimensions and the various applications which can
  be themed having different methods of themeing.</p>

  <p>This issue's interview is with WebEagle, so please read on...</p>

  <dl>
    <dt><strong>What's your name?</strong></dt>

    <dd>
      <p>My name is Tristan Jouët.</p>
    </dd>

    <dt><strong>What's your IRC/forum nickname?</strong></dt>

    <dd>
      <p>My nickname is WebEagle and I am often on the French channel (on
      Freenode).</p>
    </dd>

    <dt><strong>In what country do you live?</strong></dt>

    <dd>
      <p>I live in Paris (France).</p>
    </dd>

    <dt><strong>In what country were you born?</strong></dt>

    <dd>
      <p>I was born of course in France.</p>
    </dd>

    <dt><strong>Have you always been artistic?</strong></dt>

    <dd>
      <p>I am an officer in the paratroopers in the French Army, but I have
      loved everything related to art since I was little... I like to draw from
      time to time but that is not really my passion. I have begun doing
      web-site design but it's hard to begin it with free software (I know I
      only need to use a text editor but that's a little bit boring).</p>
    </dd>

    <dt><strong>Do you create artwork in other forms - sculpture, painting
    etc?</strong></dt>

    <dd>
      <p>I play airsoft (I know, I love action) so I love customizing (by
      painting) my replicas. I play music too (synthesizer). I love electro
      music and free music (I will also soon publish singles on Jamendo).</p>
    </dd>

    <dt><strong>What operating system(s) do you use when creating
    artwork?</strong></dt>

    <dd>
      <p>I discovered Frugalware 4 months ago , by a post (I don't remember
      where) of Devil505 and I fell under the spell of this very responsive
      distribution with a great community.</p>
    </dd>

    <dt><strong>What software do you use to create artwork?</strong></dt>

    <dd>
      <p>I only use a tablet, Gimp, and Agave to create this artwork, and of
      course on Frugalware . I did it just for fun, no stress ... Through this
      I met many very nice people like Devil505 , Lenezir , Centuri0 , Mckey
      and other super guys.</p>
    </dd>

    <dt><strong>How do you think Frugalware's artwork might be
    improved?</strong></dt>

    <dd>
      <p>I think Frugalware's artwork might be improved by a larger number of
      artists because there are only three of us and all are French, so that's
      not really funny. But Frugalware is not really famous, its installer is
      full of bugs and not very attractive, but I know the team works hard to
      arrange it all. I hope this artwork will make people want to create the
      next release's artwork and to test Locris. I hope that Locris will be
      really great ... maybe that soon you will see me as a packager ;) .</p>

  <h2><img src="http://frugalware.org/images/newsletter/community.png" align=
  "left">FLOSS developers are people too</h2>

  <p>Without developers, we wouldn't have the Linux kernel and all the software
  that we run on the platform. What motivates FLOSS developers? Why does anyone
  choose to spend their time writing software when they don't get paid to do
  so? What do developers do when they're not writing software? These questions
  and more are the inspiration behind this new section of the newsletter.</p>

  <p>In interviews with FLOSS developers, we get to know them a little better
  as people, and what motivates them in their quest for better software. I'm
  very excited by this new series because I admire their work very much. I'm
  also very grateful to them for taking the time to reply to my requests.</p>

  <p>Interviews in the next few issues will feature:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>The developer of Code Browser;</li>

    <li>David Siegel - Gnome Do developer;</li>

    <li>Jesse van den Kieboom - gedit developer.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>This issue, we have an interview with Ali Abdallah - Xfce and Parole
  developer</p>

  <dl>
    <dt><strong>What's your name?</strong></dt>

    <dd>
      <p>Ali Abdallah</p>
    </dd>

    <dt><strong>What FLOSS projects are you involved in?</strong></dt>

    <dd>
      <p>The Xfce Goodies Project, which includes additional software for Xfce
      to make this desktop environment more complete. I developed a power
      manager and currently I'm developing a media player called Parole, with
      plans for more projects.</p>
    </dd>

    <dt><strong>What led to you being a FLOSS
    developer/contributor?</strong></dt>

    <dd>
      <p>I was having fun building my own packages from scratch to get a
      functional system. I knew Xfce by coincidence from a forum, got its
      source code and started building it. Without too much pain and external
      dependencies, I quickly got a fast, simple and usable desktop
      environment. At that moment also I was reading a book about Gtk+. Having
      the book and the Xfce code as perfect examples in front of me was a big
      motivation to start learning real world programming, so I started by
      writing my own battery plug-in for the Xfce panel. Shortly after that I
      started to work on a power manager for Xfce, since it didn't have one. I
      sent my work to the Xfce mailing list and they were very kind to
      encourage me to continue.</p>
    </dd>

    <dt><strong>What do you like about being a FLOSS
    developer/contributor?</strong></dt>

    <dd>
      <p>Freedom and knowledge sharing, the thing that when you work on a
      project and you publish the results including the source code is a major
      point. Just like Math when you work on a theory and you publish your work
      so other people can contribute and continue its improvements. This is the
      case in Math and FLOSS, but unfortunately it is not in computer science.
      FLOSS is a very big source of information. When I work on a project for
      Xfce I already have many working examples to learn from, to get their
      source, modify it if needed and publish the modifications.</p>
    </dd>

    <dt><strong>What don't you like about being a FLOSS
    developer/contributor?</strong></dt>

    <dd>
      <p>Too much freedom probably. Let me explain, it is not about FLOSS
      itself, but it is about two issues that I face all the time as a FLOSS
      developer, contributor and user. First, the relationship between the
      developer and the end users is sometimes horrible. A simple search on a
      bug tracker system of a FLOSS project will most probably reveal sentences
      like, "you don't pay me", "it is working for me, if you have a problem
      with it fix it yourself", "don't waste my time" and so on... In addition
      you will see important bug reports that are lingering forever,
      fortunately this is not the case in Xfce. Honestly I'm not saying that
      because I work for this project, but I face this problem myself almost
      everywhere.</p>
    </dd>

    <dd>
      <p>Second the developers of FLOSS feel that they have too much freedom to
      completely re-write their projects. Things get complicated when these
      projects are important services and libraries. If there is an API change
      it makes life harder, specially for desktop developers, to keep their
      project compatible with these changes. But I have to say this is reduced
      a lot these days, and now i feel that there is a clear strategy on how
      things should go.</p>
    </dd>

    <dt><strong>What motivates you to work on your project(s)?</strong></dt>

    <dd>
      <p>The same motivation that motivates me to work on Math, drink alcohol
      have sex and other things that I like, the pleasure.</p>
    </dd>

    <dt><strong>What do you do outside the FLOSS world?</strong></dt>

    <dd>
      <p>Professionally, I work for the the European Organization for Nuclear
      Research - CERN, as a programmer. Aside from that, as I'm mathematician
      by the way, I'm interested in mathematics and fundamentals, especially
      logic, and i work in my free time on these topics.</p>
    </dd>

    <dt><strong>What operating system(s) do you use and why?</strong></dt>

    <dd>
      <p>I use Linux, on my laptop and my home server, because I have the
      possibility to study it and at any time I can modify a part of it to fit
      my needs. Of course this is possible on other operating systems but I use
      Linux because in the last three years Linux gained good hardware support
      compared to other operating systems. In addition a lot of FLOSS projects
      are developed and tested under Linux.</p>
    </dd>

    <dt><strong>If people are interested in helping your project(s), how might
    they do this?</strong></dt>

    <dd>
      <p>Probably in my projects I need people to translate into their own
      native language and to test of course. In Xfce we are in need of people,
      there are a lot of things to do, for very few people. It is a pleasure
      for everybody in Xfce to see people wanting to contribute to this nice
      project.</p>
    </dd>

  <h2>Getting To Know You</h2>

  <p>In this section of the newsletter, we get to know Frugalware Linux a
  little at a time. This is not meant to replace the official documentation but
  instead make it easier to read. This should suit those those people who, like
  me, have short attention spans. :)</p>

  <h2><img src="http://frugalware.org/images/newsletter/tip.png" align=
  "left">Tips and tricks</h2>

  <p><b>Disclaimer</b> - Be aware that the hints &amp; tips provided here have
  NOT been tested and so come with no warranty.</p>

  <h3>Configuring font settings without a desktop environment - ryuo</h3>

  <p>Configuring the appearance of your desktop is easy if you are using a
  desktop environment such as GNOME, KDE, Xfce etc. But how do you configure
  these options if you are <em>not</em> using</p>a desktop environment? This
  question has been answered by Frugalware developer ryuo.

  <p>There are several options available which you can set to change the
  appearance of fonts. To set these without a desktop environment, you have to
  edit a file named .Xdefaults, in your home directory. If you don't already
  have such a file, simply create it. Below is a table of the options and the
  values to which they can be set. Put one setting on a line, a space, then the
  desired value. To enable most of these settings requires you to restart
  X.</p>

  <dl>
    <dt>Xft.dpi:</dt>

    <dd>This option defines the resolution at which X is to run. For best
    results, make sure your monitor can use this resolution.</dd>

    <dt>Xft.rgba:</dt>

    <dd>This option defines the subpixel hinting. Options are: rgb, bgr, vrgb,
    vbgr and none. Refer to your monitor's manual for the optimal value.</dd>

    <dt>Xft.hinting:</dt>

    <dd>This option turns hinting on or off. Options are: true or false.</dd>

    <dt>Xft.hintstyle:</dt>

    <dd>This option defines the hinting style. Options are: hintslight,
    hintmedium, hintfull or hintnone.</dd>
  </dl>

  <h3>Got a problem? Ask your teddy bear!</h3>

  <p>In a blog article I read recently (which was apparently based on another
  blog post), readers were encouraged to talk to their teddy bear if they had a
  problem. The idea was that if you had a problem, you could sometimes solve it
  yourself if you had to explain it to someone. Simply explaining the problem
  and its symptoms to someone else sometimes brings on a "eureka" moment, when
  something in your brain clicks and you suddenly think of the solution
  yourself. In the original blog entry or article, a person in a technical
  support role would not listen to people's problems until they had first
  explained it to the teddy bear tied to his desk. This person found that many
  people turned away, having solved their problem for themselves.</p>

  <p>Before reporting a bug then, perhaps you could first try explaining it to
  your teddy bear. If you don't have a teddy bear, perhaps choose something
  else - maybe a door? Just make sure you are alone, otherwise you might solve
  your technical problem but find yourself with another problem. :P</p>

  <p>This section relies on your contributions! If you have some tips and
  tricks that you would like to be shown in the newsletter, <em>please</em>
  post them on the forums.</p>

  <h2><img src="http://frugalware.org/images/newsletter/package.png" align=
  "left">Focus On Package(s)</h2><br>

  <h3>Droid fonts set</h3>

  <p>Frugalware developer Devil505 recently took a break from packaging games
  and instead packaged the <a href="http://www.droidfonts.com">Droid</a> set of
  fonts. The TrueType fonts were created specifically for the Android mobile
  platform, but they are compatible with Linux and other platforms. They were
  designed to look stylish but also be clear and crisp, especially important on
  a small screen. The set of fonts currently includes Droid Sans, Droid Sans
  Mono and Droid Serif, with condensed versions of Droid Sans in development.
  The Sans Mono (obviously a monospace font) is especially nice, so try it in
  your favourite terminal emulator, text editor or IDE.</p>

  <p>If you are interested in fonts, please also read the <a href=
  "http://www.droidfonts.com/droidfonts/about/">story</a> about the development
  of the Droid fonts because it's very interesting. Like the software we run on

  discovered and fixed in the 1.1 release since the previous newsletter.</p>
