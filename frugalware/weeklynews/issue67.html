  "left">Events etc</h2>

  <p>Here's a selection of recent events and other items that you might find
  interesting:</p>

  <h3>Turkish translations are in progress</h3>

  <p>Frugalware user Tutku has been very busy recently, translating many of
  Frugalware's projects, including the installer, Fwife and Gfpm. The speed at
  which he has been working is simply amazing. It seemed that he requested
  access to <a href="http://pootle.frugalware.org/">Pootle</a> one day and the
  very next day was announcing that he had finished! This is not Tutku's first
  translation work for Frugalware. In fact he's been providing Turkish
  translations for about one year. Many thanks to Tutku because his work makes
  Frugalware accessible to more people and that's good for everyone.</p>

  <h3>Default wallpaper for Frugalware 1.3</h3>

  <p>The default wallpaper for Frugalware 1.3 has been chosen and the winner
  was...Webeagle! Congratulations to him because it looks simply amazing. For
  this release we had the most number of entries ever received - 22 - so
  thankyou to everyone who submitted an entry. We <strong>really</strong>
  appreciate all your hard work. The frugalware-backgrounds-extra package has
  been updated so if you install it you can see every wallpaper ever submitted
  as an official wallpaper.</p>

  <h3>Wanted! New homes for packages</h3>

  <p>Every Frugalware has a maintainer, someone who is responsible for keeping
  the package up to date and fixing any bugs which are reported. Sometimes
  people can no longer maintain their packages, either temporarily or
  permanently and so others need to take them on. Developer Devil505 recently
  produced a list of packages which need new maintainers and the developers are
  currently working through the list. I'm not sure what happens if we get near
  the end of the list and only ugly ones are left. We might have to run a
  lottery. Maybe we could wait for a new developer and give them a "To Do" list
  on their first day? :P</p>

  <h3>Frugalware - The Game!</h3>

  <p>Computer games, whether played on consoles or PCs, are very popular in
  modern society. What if just a small fraction of the many millions of people
  who play games were introduced to what it's like to be a Frugalware
  developer? The future of Frugalware would be guaranteed, and that's the
  reason behind the development of "Frugalware - The Game!" In the style of
  "Little Big Planet", players will progress through the game if they can
  successfully package applications. They will have to search for and find the
  various dependencies, then submit their FrugalBuild to the buildbot. If they
  have been successful, they may gain points, which could allow them to advance
  to the next level. Bugs will be represented by real bugs and players will
  have to squash them as quickly as they can. If there are too many bugs they
  may attack the player, harming their health or possibly killing them. Missing
  dependencies or incorrect dependencies will also cost the player health
  points. All packages created by a player in a level have to be maintained by
  them until they advance to the next level. At each level the packages to be
  maintained will become more difficult. I can't reveal what is waiting for the
  player when they complete the game, but it's definitely a prize worth
  winning!</p>

  <h3>Frugalware exam #2 - <strong>Answers</strong></h3>

  <h2><img src="http://frugalware.org/images/newsletter/community.png" align=
  "left">FLOSS developers are people too</h2>

  <p>Without developers, we wouldn't have the Linux kernel and all the software
  that we run on the platform. What motivates FLOSS developers? Why does anyone
  choose to spend their time writing software when they don't get paid to do
  so? What do developers do when they're not writing software? These questions
  and more are the inspiration behind this new section of the newsletter. Many
  thanks to all the developers who have agreed to this interview.</p>

  <p>This issue, we have an interview with Daniel G. Taylor, developer of
  Arista Transcoder (amongst many other things, as you'll read).</p>

  <dl>
    <dt><strong>What FLOSS projects are you involved in?</strong></dt>

    <dd>
      <p>I am or have been involved with Gentoo's Portage package management
      system, the Gentoo Porthole GUI, Imendio's Gossip instant messenger and
      BLAM! feed reader, Novell's compiz, GNOME-MUD, FFmpeg, GStreamer, Arista
      Transcoder, the most-used Paypal integration module for Django, the
      Braintree python library, the Common Component Architecture used in U.S.
      Department of Energy research laboratories, Simple Stats for tracking
      video engagement statistics on the web, an IBM 650 emulator, a keyboard
      and mouse status monitor used in many screencast tutorials, and many more
      on my website, github, etc.</p>
    </dd>

    <dt><strong>What led to you being a FLOSS
    developer/contributor?</strong></dt>

    <dd>
      <p>I love to tinker. I started learning Visual Basic (boo, hiss) way back
      when a friend sent me a how-to book and a CD with Microsoft Visual
      Studio. I started to teach myself C. In school, I started taking C++
      classes. I started to follow Linux, GNOME, and the entire FLOSS movement
      as a whole, and became obsessed with the idea of thousands of people
      around the world working in their spare time doing what they love to
      create something amazing, rivaling products created by industry-leading
      corporations.</p>

      <p>I started to hang out on IRC and mailing lists, and taught myself PHP,
      Python, and eventually Ruby. It wasn't until much later that I was a very
      good C coder. At the university I attended I studied theoretical computer
      science and psychology, and most of my professors allowed me to do my
      school work whichever language I choose. I chose Python, and started to
      contribute to various projects I could find with artwork, documentation,
      and eventually small snippets of code or bug reports.</p>

      <p>After a while I decided to create my own first big project, and wound
      up working with a few others to make a graphical Python application using
      GTK+. It was my first introduction to working on a real team, code
      revision systems, mailing lists, etc. Since then I haven't looked
      back.</p>
    </dd>

    <dt><strong>Why did you create the Arista Transcoder?</strong></dt>

    <dd>
      <p>I was trying to create a proof-of-concept for a user-friendly desktop
      transcoder that people would actually want to use. The goal was to remove
      all the complexity from media conversion, provide live feedback about
      what is going on, and to do so without really knowing many of the
      technologies I was about to make use of. I already knew Python and had
      done some GTK+ work, so I learned DBus+HAL, GStreamer, gettext,
      lower-level GDK stuff, how to build custom GTK+ widgets, eventually udev,
      desktop notifications, and more. I did my best to design a useful user
      interface, tried to polish it as best I could, and released it into the
      wild. The response from people was amazing, and today Arista Transcoder
      is featured on blogs, magazines, tweets, Youtube videos, and even in the
      Ubuntu 10.04 software center.</p>
    </dd>

    <dt><strong>What do you like about being a FLOSS
    developer/contributor?</strong></dt>

    <dd>
      <p>I feel like I'm helping to make the world a better place, while
      enjoying what I do and broadening my knowledge on a number of subjects
      and technologies. I regularly get contacted by users of my software
      thanking me for doing what I do.</p>

      <p>Working with FLOSS has helped land me jobs, get me noticed, and has
      helped me make many long-term friends in places of the world I'd never
      imagine being. For example, last summer the GNOME Foundation sponsored me
      to fly and stay in Gran Canaria in the Canary Islands off the coast of
      Africa and meet the core GStreamer developers. I also met many RedHat,
      Intel, Collabora, Nokia, and other developers there, who are surprisingly
      a lot like you or me.</p>
    </dd>

    <dt><strong>What don't you like about being a FLOSS
    developer/contributor?</strong></dt>

    <dd>
      <p>Honestly, you deal with a lot of assholes. People that make or
      maintain projects tend to sometimes be ego-maniacal jerks, and I can see
      where it comes from but it not only makes it hard for general people to
      contribute, but also gives FLOSS a bad name (we've all heard the stories
      of being told to RTFM n00b!)</p>

      <p>Other people think that they can boss you around and tell you what you
      need to do with your free time for them. They are delusional about what
      this is - me working on stuff I enjoy when I have time.</p>
    </dd>

    <dt><strong>What advice would you give to others who were thinking about
    becoming a FLOSS developer/contributor?</strong></dt>

    <dd>
      <p>Pick something you are interested in doing or learning, and do it!
      Remember that the people that are rude to you don't represent us all, so
      if you run into some of them just continue on.</p>
    </dd>

    <dt><strong>What do you do outside the FLOSS world?</strong></dt>

    <dd>
      <p>My day job is working as a transcoding engineer for an Internet media
      content management, conversion, deployment, and advertising company in
      New York City. In my free time I travel all over the world, play electric
      guitar, grow a garden, cook, read, and go out partying it up with
      friends.</p>
    </dd>

    <dt><strong>What operating system(s) do you use and why?</strong></dt>

    <dd>
      <p>I have been using only Linux since 2003 (and used it alongside Windows
      before then). I started with Gentoo, then RedHat, and have used Ubuntu
      since 2004. I currently use Ubuntu 10.04. It is fast, simple, popular,
      easy to use, and just generally works so that I can work on the things I
      like rather than fighting with my operating system.</p>

      <p>I also own a Macbook and it has Mac OS X on it, though I mainly run
      Ubuntu on there as well. Mac OS X has influenced me to focus on simple,
      usable desktop apps which was the main idea behind Arista Transcoder.</p>
    </dd>

    <dt><strong>If people are interested in helping your project(s), how might
    they do this?</strong></dt>

    <dd>
      <p>Projects always need artwork/media presence, websites, translations,
      help / documentation, and users seem to have a never-ending ability to
      find even the smallest bugs that need to be fixed. Depending on where
      your skills lie, pick something you like and get in touch with me!</p>

      <p>Don't worry if you don't know how to do much. We all have to start
      somewhere, and I can promise to be understanding and will try to teach
      anyone willing to learn what I know.</p>
    </dd>

    <dt><strong>Your web site features your photography as well as your FLOSS
    development. Do you think of yourself as an artist who is also a FLOSS
    developer, or a FLOSS developer who is also an artist? Is there a link for
    you between these two activities, or is it by chance that you do
    both?</strong></dt>

    <dd>
      <p>I consider myself a computer guy that dabbles in art. I have made icon
      themes, window manager themes, 3d rendered animations, digital paintings,
      and am into photography and digital editing / panorama creation. My love
      of tinkering has made me want to try all sorts of things, so I do think
      there is a link between the two. Art is after all building something,
      just like creating a computer program from an idea in your head.</p>

  <h2><img src="http://frugalware.org/images/newsletter/tip.png" align=
  "left">Tips and tricks</h2>

  <p><b>Disclaimer</b> - Be aware that the hints &amp; tips provided here have
  NOT been tested and so come with no warranty.</p>

  <h3>"What are a package's compile-time options?" Just ask git!</h3>

  <p>If want to find out what configuration options were chosen for a specific
  package, the gitweb interface provides easy access to this information. On
  the Frugalware home page, select Download &gt; Packages from the menu, and
  search for the package by name. When the results of your search have been
  returned, you can click on "View entry" beside the "git" label. This shows
  you a list of all the files which are used to create the package. To check
  compile-time configuration settings, you can simply click on the
  <em>Frugalbuild</em> file which shows you all the settings for that specific
  package.</p>

  <h3>Get a better-looking you in less than 10 minutes!</h3>

  <p><strong>Don't send any money!</strong> You might not believe it, but it's
  true! You really <em>can</em> look more handsome or beautiful in just 10
  minutes. jKiwi is an application which allows you to change the way your head
  looks by applying virtual hairstyles and makeup. Perhaps you don't see how
  this can help in the real world? Follow these simple steps to a new you!</p>

  <ol>
    <li>Take a photo of your head;</li>

    <li>Copy this to your PC and start jKiwi;</li>

    <li>Apply new hairstyles and maybe a little makeup until the image looks as
    you want to look;</li>

    <li>Save the image and print it out on a colour printer;</li>

    <li>Stick this to a piece of light cardboard;</li>

    <li>Cut around the edge of the image, being careful not to cut off your
    hair or any other important feature;</li>

    <li>Poke small holes where your pupils are on the mask;</li>

    <li>Poke two small holes in the mask near the edge of your ears;</li>

    <li>Tie some elastic through one hole, put the mask on, measuring just
    where the other hole needs to be tied, and tie it.</li>
  </ol>

  <p>Wear the mask any time you want to look better. So go on...get out there
  and enjoy the new you!</p>

  <p>This section relies on your contributions! If you have some tips and
  tricks that you would like to be shown in the newsletter, <em>please</em>
  post them on the forums.</p>

  <h2><img src="http://frugalware.org/images/newsletter/package.png" align=
  "left">Focus On Package(s)</h2>

  <h3>yad</h3>

  <p><a href="http://code.google.com/p/yad/">yad</a> is a fork of Zenity, the
  utility which allows you to use GUI controls in scripts, either for input or
  output. According to its home page Zenity was forked because development had
  stopped, but people wanted more features, also to remove dependencies on
  deprecated libraries. If you currently use Zenity in scripts, consider using
  yad instead, because it now offers more features.</p>

  <h3>jKiwi</h3>

  <p><a href="http://jkiwi.com">jKiwi</a> is an application which allows you to
  change the appearance of your head by applying virtual makeup and a new
  hairstyle. It's a great idea, because if you're thinking of changing your
  appearance, at least you can try it out first before going ahead with it in
  real life. If there's one thing the world needs, it's definitely better
  looking geeks!</p>
