<h2>News</h2>
<p>
	Here's what's happened over the last few weeks:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		<h3>Homepage design contest winner!</h3>
		The voting for the homepage contest has ended, and I'm pleased to announce that the winner is Sakic! Congratulations to him. You can view his design <a href="http://frugalware.org/~alex/designs/sakic/xhtml/frugalware.html">here</a>.
	</li>
	<li>
		<h3>Gnetconfig</h3>
		Thanks to the hard work of Priyank, we now have a GUI tool for configuring your network. You can install it from -current with the following command:
		<pre><code>pacman-g2 -S gnetconfig</code></pre>
	</li>
	<li>
		<h3>Changing the Frugalware SCM (again)</h3>
		After testing it has been decided that Frugalware will switch to Git as it's new SCM. This is mainly due to it's speed.
	</li>

<h2>Tips and tricks</h2>

<ul>
	<li>
		<h3>Set your time and date correctly with ntpdate</h3>
		NTP is the Network Time Protocol. You can install it with:
		<pre><code>pacman-g2 -S ntp</code></pre>
		Next, you need to run ntpdate (nl.pool.ntp.org is only an example, you should put a <a href="http://www.pool.ntp.org/">server near you</a> here):
		<pre><code>ntpdate nl.pool.ntp.org</code></pre>
		Finally, to have ntpdate run on boot, add this line to /etc/rc.d/rc.local:
		<pre><code>ntpdate nl.pool.ntp.org &</code></pre>
		Of course, replace nl.pool.ntp.org with the correct server.
