<h2>Tips and tricks</h2>
<p>
	Here are some tips and tricks that have been discovered by our users to help make using your Frugalware system even easier and make your system even faster:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		<h3>Minimalistic install with GNOME</h3>
		If you want to get a minimal install with GNOME, just install only the base group from the netinstall and then install xorg-server, gnome-desktop, gnome-session and gdm using pacman. You might want to also install the xorg-fonts group and any appropriate drivers for X.org. Thanks to detto for this tip!
	</li>
	<li>
		<h3>How to always display a list of windows available in screen</h3>
		Edit your ~/.screenrc and fill it with the following contents:<br />
		<br />
		hardstatus on<br />

		hardstatus string '%{.kw}%-w%{.wk}%n %t%{-}%+w'<br />

<h2>Developer announcements</h2>
<ul>
	<li>
		Unfortunately our x86_64 maintainer has been away and therefore the x86_64 CDs for 0.6 haven't been tested properly for this release. It has now been discovered that these ISOs do not work at all, therefore you cannot install Frugalware x86_64 using the 0.6 ISOs. If you would like to use the x86_64 version, you should use the 0.5 x86_64 netinstall from <a href="http://ftp.frugalware.org/pub/archive/frugalware-0.5-iso/">here</a>. We are really sorry about this, and we are sorry for any inconvenience this may cause/has caused

<h2>Security announcements</h2>
<p>
	Here are a list of <a href="/security">security issues</a> which have been discovered and fixed in the 0.6 release in the past 2 weeks:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>FSA141 - nas: Luigi Auriemma has reported some vulnerabilities in Network Audio System, which potentially can be exploited by malicious, local users to gain escalated privileges or by malicious people to cause a DoS (Denial of Service). Please upgrade to nas-1.8-2terminus1</li>
	<li>FSA140 - inkscape: Some vulnerabilities have been reported in Inkscape, which potentially can be exploited by malicious people to compromise a user's system. Please upgrade to inkscape-0.45.1-1terminus1</li>
	<li>FSA139 - kernel: Some vulnerabilities have been reported in the Linux Kernel, which can be exploited by malicious, local users to cause a DoS (Denial of Service). Please upgrade to kernel-2.6.20-5terminus1</li>
	<li>FSA138 - squid: A vulnerability has been reported in Squid, which can be exploited by malicious people to cause a DoS (Denial of Service). Please upgrade to squid-2.6.STABLE12-1terminus1</li>
	<li>FSA137 - firefox: The FTP protocol includes the PASV (passive) command which is used by Firefox to request an alternate data port. The specification of the FTP protocol allows the server response to include an alternate server address as well, although this is rarely used in practice. mark@bindshell.net reported that a malicious web page hosted on a specially-coded FTP server could use this feature to perform a rudimentary port-scan of machines inside the firewall of the victim. Please upgrade to firefox-2.0.0.3-1terminus1</li>
	<li>FSA136 - libwpd: Some vulnerabilities have been reported in libwpd, which can be exploited by malicious people to cause a DoS (Denial of Service) or to compromise an application using the library. Please upgrade to libwpd-0.8.9-1terminus1</li>
	<li>FSA135 - mplayer: Some vulnerabilities have been reported in MPlayer, which can potentially be exploited by malicious people to compromise a user's system. Please upgrade to mplayer-1.0rc1-4terminus1</li>
</ul>
