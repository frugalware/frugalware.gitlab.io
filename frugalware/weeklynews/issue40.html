<h2>Events</h2></a>

<p>Here's a selection of events which have occurred since the previous newsletter:</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        <h3>Frugalware 1.0 RC1 released</h3>
        <p>On 22 February 2009, VMiklos released 1.0 RC1, the second last testing release prior to 1.0.  If you have the required bandwidth and time available, please download and test this release.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h3>Find me a floppy disk</h3>
        <p>Recently the following change was committed to Frugalware's main git repository:<pre>
commit 1b956327c9d1a03582e898b8552554863d1eb52d
Author: Miklos Vajna <vmiklos@frugalware.org>
Date:   Mon Feb 23 22:57:17 2009 +0100

fdutils-5.5-6-i686

- move to extra</pre>
        <p>fdutils' description is "Utilities for formatting floppies and configuring the floppy drive."  Personally I think the better change might have been "move to /dev/null".  Of course I'm saying that simply because I no longer use a floppy disk drive.  If you have no choice but to back up 40 GB or more data via floppy disks then I feel <strong>very</strong> sorry for you.</p>
</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h3>Anacreon's default wallpaper is released</h3>
        <p>The new default wallpaper of Anacreon is here!  If you didn't already know, the wallpaper named "Simply Frugal" has been chosen by the development team.  Congratulations to its creator, Léo.  Grub and Splashy themes were updated with this wallpaper last week with help from Ironiq.  The new default wallpaper is included in the Gnome and LXDE desktop environments in the 'current' repository (thanks to Bouleetbil).  Here is a screenshot of a Gnome desktop, featuring the wallpaper:</p>
        <img src="http://frugalware.org/images/newsletter/issue40_desktop_anacreon_gnome_example.png">
        <p>This new wallpaper will be added soon to the Xfce4 and KDE desktops.  Widescreen users, don't worry, you can find a widescreen version of this wallpaper <a href="http://ftp.frugalware.org/pub/other/artwork/wallpaper/1.0wide.jpg">here</a>.
</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h3>Want more wallpapers ?</h3>
        <p>All remaining wallpapers of the <a href="http://frugalware.org/~devil505/artwork10/wallpapers.html">selection</a> are not lost.  They are now included in a package, to install it:
        <pre># pacman-g2 -S frugalware-backgrounds</pre>
        Then you'll find these additional wallpapers in <i>/usr/share/backgrounds/Frugalware</i></p>
    </li>

<h2>Frugalware's users are people too - fanch</h2></a>

<p>This interview is the latest in a series of interviews with Frugalware users.  Please read on...</p>

<dl>
    <dt><strong>What's your name?</strong></dt>
        <dd><p>François Visdeloup.</p></dd>

    <dt><strong>What's your IRC/forum nickname?</strong></dt>
        <dd><p>fanch or fym (I chose my first name or the initials of my first name in the Britain language).</p></dd>

    <dt><strong>In what country do you live?</strong></dt>
        <dd><p>Britain region (France).</p></dd>

    <dt><strong>In what country were you born?</strong></dt>
        <dd><p>Britain region (France).</p></dd>

    <dt><strong>What do you like the most about where you live (the town/city and country)?</strong></dt>
        <dd><p>I like my region and all the rest.  The mountain is missing maybe.  We can't have it all.</p></dd>

    <dt><strong>What operating system(s) did you used before FW ?</strong></dt>
        <dd><p>Brief history : Windows 98 to 2008....video manipulation only - Ubuntu 2005 to 2007 - Suse 1998 to
2004 and Mandrake 1998 to 2000 and 2004 to 2005 approximately.  Since 2007 Frugalware and Sabayon.  2008/09 Nutyx.</p></dd>

    <dt><strong>When did you start to use Linux (Frugalware)?</strong></dt>
        <dd><p>At the end of 2007.</p></dd>

    <dt><strong>What do you like most about Frugalware?</strong></dt>
        <dd><p>The updates (always the latest versions but not for KDE 4 but this isn't a problem for me because I use Gnome).  The developers reactivity, contacts to find solutions.  In one word: conviviality.</p></dd>

    <dt><strong>What would you like to see changed in Frugalware?</strong></dt>
        <dd><p>More effort on network connections like WiFi, troubles with hardware.  In spite of that, I have nothing to say, I'm very satisfied.</p></dd>

    <dt><strong>Do you do something active in order to spread the knowledge of Frugalware?</strong></dt>
        <dd><p>I talk about it with people around me.  Unfortunately people have difficulty seeing other OSs than Windows. They know a little about Ubuntu.  Many of them think free software is not reliable.  Windows still has some days to live.</p></dd>

    <dt><strong>For what purpose(s) do you use Frugalware?</strong></dt>
        <dd><p>On PC or laptop - I use Frugalware like I used Windows, except for video manipulation where Windows is still necessary, for games for example.  For the rest, there are only advantages (Internet - office work - downloading - photos - etc....)</p></dd>

    <dt><strong>How did you find Frugalware - e.g. a friend/Google search?</strong></dt>
        <dd><p>On Distrowatch and QuebecOS.  I was looking for a distribution with regular updates to avoid re-installations.</p></dd>

    <dt><strong>What do you do when you're not using Frugalware?</strong></dt>
        <dd><p>I use Sabayon or Nutyx.</p></dd>

    <dt><strong>Please show us a screenshot of your desktop(s)</strong></dt>
        <dd><p>It's not interesting because my desktop is not like the Frugalware Gnome default.  I'm not very good at making my desktop look nice.  I regret not having the previous default desktop, it was original.  I liked it (http://ftp.frugalware.org/pub/other/artwork/wallpaper/0.6.jpg) but for me it's not a priority.</p></dd>

    <dt><strong>What's the view from your front door? (please provide a photograph, with no people in view)</strong></dt>
        <dd><p>I'm in my basement.  I am surrounded by computers (one for a family member and three for me.. LOL...).  It's dark.  A worldmap on the wall and some photos of Dinard... It's a room only for computing.  So, again, a photo doesn't show anything interesting.  I'm sorry, I would present you a nice view.  It's a "bunker" atmosphere here LOL......</p></dd>

<h2>Getting To Know You</h2>

<p>In this section of the newsletter, we get to know Frugalware Linux a little at a time.  This is not meant to replace the official documentation but instead make it easier to read.  This should suit those those people who, like me, have short attention spans.  :)</p>

<h3>Reporting Bugs 101</h3>
<p>Bug reports are welcome but before you go ahead, there are a few things you need to know.  First - are you sure it's a bug?  If something's not working correctly it may not be because of a bug in the software.  You could check the Frugalware Bug Tracking System (BTS) and the upstream BTS to see if someone has already reported this as a bug.  If you're still not sure, you could mention it in the Frugalware forums or in the IRC channel.  In that way someone may be able to confirm if it's a bug or not.</p>


<h2>Tips and tricks</h2>

<b>Disclaimer</b> - Be aware that the hints &amp; tips provided here have NOT been tested and so come with no warranty.

<ul>
    <li>
        <h3>IdentiBash</h3>
        <p><a href="http://lincgeek.org/lincware/viewforum.php?f=6&amp;sid=f7c1274b91f9e6517b51ac9ded670fee">IdentiBash</a> is a simple Bash script that you can use as a command line Twitter/identi.ca client.  To use it you change just a few parameters in the script - URLs, username and password, and you can then both post your own messages and get those of others.  The script was created by linc of <a href="http://www.tllts.org/">The Linux Link Tech Show</a>, based on an article published by IBM.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h3>Don't just write - rewrite!</h3>
        <p>Rewriteable CD and DVD media is a cheap storage medium, useful for testing ISOs or backups.  They cost more than write once media but you can use them more times and so the cost should balance out.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h3>Beautiful wallpapers</h3>
        <p>If newsletter issue 39's list of wallpaper sites wasn't enough, here are two more sites which host beautiful wallpapers:</p>

        <ul>
            <li><a href="http://www.vladstudio.com/">VladStudio</a></li>
            <li><a href="http://wall.alphacoders.com/">Wallpaper Abyss</a></li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h3>Get a widescreen monitor for <strong>NO</strong> money!</h3>
        <p>In these difficult economic times, hardware upgrades may have to wait.  Here's a hint, though, as to how you can get the look of a widescreen monitor without spending any money.  The process is quite simple:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Find a widescreen wallpaper, <a href="http://ftp.frugalware.org/pub/other/artwork/wallpaper/1.0wide.jpg">this one</a>, for example;</li>
            <li>Print out the wallpaper in colour and in a size where the height is equal to the height of your monitor;</li>
            <li>Place the printed wallpaper on your existing monitor and mark those parts that stick out at the sides;</li>
            <li>Cut off those parts of the wallpaper which you just marked and stick them at either side of the monitor;</li>
            <li>In your desktop environment, set the wallpaper to the same file.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Voila!  All your friends will be envious when they see your new, "widescreen" monitor.  Just don't let them get too close.  If you print and cut out some digits, you can even have a desktop clock, but it can be difficult to change the digits at just the right time.  Note that you should <strong>not</strong> stick the printed wallpaper with permanent glue since you might want to change it later.</p>
    </li>
</ul>

<p>This section relies on your contributions! If have some tips and tricks that you would like to be shown in the newsletter, <em>please</em> post them on the forums.</p>


<h2>Focus On Package(s)</h2>

<h3>Just burn it!</h3>
<p><a href="http://sallu.tuxfamily.org/">SimpleBurn</a> is an application with just one purpose, to burn ISOs to recordable CD/DVD media.  It has very few dependencies so it suits those using window managers as well as those using full desktop environments.</p>

<h3>etckeeper</h3>
<p><a href="http://kitenet.net/~joey/code/etckeeper/">etckeeper</a> "is a collection of tools to let /etc be stored in a git, mercurial, darcs, or bzr repository. It hooks into apt (and other package managers including yum and pacman-g2) to automatically commit changes made to /etc during package upgrades. It tracks file metadata that revison control systems do not normally support, but that is important for /etc, such as the permissions of /etc/shadow. It's quite modular and configurable, while also being simple to use if you understand the basics of working with revision control."</p>
