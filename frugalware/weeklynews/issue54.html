      <h3>New artwork for 'Locris'</h3>

      <p>Artwork for Frugalware release 1.2 - code-name 'Locris' is already in
      progress. If you want to see an example of what the artwork team are
      working on, look <a href=
      "http://artwork.frugalware.org/doku.php?id=artwork12">here</a>. The
      release of 1.2 is not due until March 2010, so there is plenty of time to
      work on artwork. If you would like to produce a piece of artwork - a
      wallpaper, a splashscreen, whatever you want - please do because we'd
      like to see your work. Post anything you create to the Frugalware forums
      with a few words about your creation. If you have ideas about artwork
      that you think should be the default for Locris, please also post a
      message in the Frugalware forums. This gives others a chance to discuss
      your ideas.</p>

      <p>A lot of thought and work went into the artwork for release 1.1 -
      'Getorin'. We had a new, fantastic wallpaper created by Centuri0, which
      was the basis for all other splashscreens and GDM etc. We also had a new
      default GTK theme and icons set. All this made Getorin look great and
      we're hoping that Locris will look even better. I believe that Steve Jobs
      gave the design team for the Mac instructions that he wanted to make
      people using it want to lick the icons off the screen. Our goal is to
      make Frugalware look so good, users will want to kiss their PC. The only
      problem is if one of Devil505's usual wallpapers (go to
      http://frugalware-art.org and search for anything submitted by Devil505)
      becomes the default for 1.2, you might be kissing a semi-naked woman. Try
      to explain <strong>that</strong> to your friends and family!</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <h3>Frugalware 1.2 -'Locris' pre1 has been released</h3>

      <p>On 7 November 2009, VMiklos announced the release of Frugalware Linux
      1.1pre1, the first pre-release. These are released so that everyone who
      is interested can test it and report bugs before the final release. As I
      say with every release, if you have the bandwidth and time required,
      <strong>please</strong> test it. The developer team need your help to
      make 1.2 the very best we can.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <h3>"Who turned out the lights?"</h3>

      <p>You may have noticed that several of the Frugalware web sites were
      offline recently for a few days. This downtime was caused by a hardware
      problem with 'Helicon', one of the Frugalware servers. Hardware
      maintenance on the server had actually been planned but the hardware
      fault occurred before the planned date for the maintenance. It's not all
      bad news, though, because Helicon had better CPUs installed, making it a
      more powerful server than before. Apologies to everyone for the downtime
      but such things do happen sometimes. We hope you managed to find
      something else to do instead of browsing the Frugalware home page and Bug
      Tracker System.</p>

      <p>identi.ca - a microblogging service running on a FLOSS platform - has
      been mentioned previously in the newsletter. When VMiklos noticed the
      problem with Helicon, he posted several messages about it from his
      identi.ca account to FIXME. If you have an account on identi.ca, you
      should subscribe to vmiklos' messages, perhaps also the Frugalware group
      (using the "!frugalware" tag).</p>

      <h3>Plymouth has been added to 'current'</h3>

      <p>Plymouth is a new system for providing graphical bootup and shutdown
      screens. You might be asking why there's a new method when we already use
      Splashy. Plymouth's main advantage is that from when the Linux kernel is
      loaded by GRUB, there are no video mode changes. Instead of showing a
      wallpaper with a crude progress bar, Plymouth has a beautiful display. It
      was developed by Red Hat and is now the default graphical boot display
      for Fedora.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <h3>ryuo's on a mission!</h3>

      <p>Since Devil505 joined the Frugalware developer team, he's added a lot
      of games to the repository. So many, in fact, that he's earned the title
      "Games Master". ryuo, another developer, has made his mission to add any
      many text editors as he can find to the repository, and so earned the
      title of "Master of the Editors". I prefer to call him "Tex", but the
      reason for that will stay a secret between us.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <h3>pete has been tidying the "house"</h3>

      <p>Frugalware user and contributor 'pete' recently volunteered to tidy up
      the Frugalware Bug Tracker System. The work involves tasks such as:
      closing bugs which relate to unsupported releases, asking people if the
      bug they reported is still happening, and checking if people still want
      packages they requested. Many thanks to pete for his work because a tidy
      BTS is a sign of a healthy, active project. It's not interesting work,
      and won't bring pete fame, but it's important work and it's
      appreciated.</p>

  </ul>

  <h2>FLOSS developers are people too</h2>

  <p>Without developers, we wouldn't have the Linux kernel and all the software
  that we run on the platform. What motivates FLOSS developers? Why does anyone
  choose to spend their time writing software when they don't get paid to do
  so? What do developers do when they're not writing software? These questions
  and more are the inspiration behind this new section of the newsletter.</p>

  <p>In interviews with FLOSS developers, we get to know them a little better
  as people, and what motivates them in their quest for better software. I'm
  very excited by this new series because I admire their work very much. I'm
  also very grateful to them for taking the time to reply to my requests.</p>

  <p>Interviews in the next few issues will feature:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Michael Cornelius - developer of fotoxx, UKopp, picpuz and much
    more;</li>

    <li>The developer of Code Browser;</li>

    <li>Jeff Bailes - developer of Whaaw! Media Player.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>This issue, we have an interview with Stuart Rackham, lead developer of
  ASCIIDOC. We use ASCIIDOC to produce all our own documentation because it
  allows us to produce various formats from just one source.</p>

  <h2>Getting To Know You</h2>

  <p>In this section of the newsletter, we get to know Frugalware Linux a
  little at a time. This is not meant to replace the official documentation but
  instead make it easier to read. This should suit those those people who, like
  me, have short attention spans. :)</p>

  <h3>What is a FrugalBuild?</h3>

  <p>Briefly, a FrugalBuild is a text file which defines the configuration
  parameters and commands which are required to build a Frugalware package.
  Included are details of the packages' dependencies, also a method of
  confirming if the packaged version is the latest version. From the
  instructions in these files, Frugalware's build servers create each package.
  Another great feature is the use of a SHA1 hash to confirm that source files
  are valid. Servers are sometimes hacked, and having the SHA1 feature means
  that before a package is built from source, the SHA1 has of the source files
  downloaded from the site are checked against the SHA1 hash in the FrugalBuild
  file. If they're different, the build is stopped, to avoid using possibly
  hacked source. As with all other Frugalware source files, FrugalBuild files
  are maintained under version control using git. If a change to a package
  causes a problem, the change is easily reversed and/or corrected. It's an
  excellent, reliable system but as with most things in the FLOSS world, the
  developer team are always looking to improve it. Next time you "pacman -S
  [package]", think for a moment about all that has been done to get the
  package ready for installation.</p>

  <h2>Tips and tricks</h2>

  <p><b>Disclaimer</b> - Be aware that the hints &amp; tips provided here have
  NOT been tested and so come with no warranty.</p>

  <h3>pacman-g2's "download only" option</h3>

  <p>pacman-g2 has a synchronisation option "-w" which will download but not
  install the required packages. This option can be useful if, for example, you
  have several PCs running Frugalware but only one of these has Internet
  access. With the "download only" option you could have pacman-g2 download the
  required packages, then copy them from its cache (/var/cache/pacman/pkg by
  default) to the other PC's cache. When you install the packages on the other
  PC, pacman-g2 will recognise that the packages are already in its cache and
  install them, without requiring Internet access.</p>

  <h3>zgrep</h3>

  <p>zgrep is a utility which allows you to perform grep operations against
  compressed files. This is particularly useful if, for example, you compress
  log files or similar files. Log files tend to be very large, but compress
  very well, and this is commonly done with a cron job. Without zgrep, you
  would first have to manually uncompress the log files, then run grep against
  them. zgrep makes this task a lot easier since it does the temporary
  decompression for you. Of course this is just one example of possible uses
  for zgrep.</p>

  <p>This section relies on your contributions! If have some tips and tricks
  that you would like to be shown in the newsletter, <em>please</em> post them
  on the forums.</p>

  <h2>Focus On Package(s)</h2>

  <h3>OGMRip</h3>

  <p>OGMRip is a Gtk-based GUI application which allows you to copy ("rip")
  content from DVDs, into your preferred format. It's very easy to use, with
  the basic process of copying content being: (1) select desired content, (2)
  select pre-defined output format, (3) click on [Go]. FIXME - find correct
  'Go' button's label. If you want to extract content from several sources,
  OGMRip has an enqueue option, which will add the copying job to a queue, and
  when you're ready you can start them all and they will be processed in turn.
  OGMRip's pre-defined output options are great, because you can define all the
  various parameters for a target just once, and can then select it from the
  drop-down list whenever you need to. For example, you could have one target
  defined for your portable video player, and another one for your PC. Using
  predefined output options mean that if you're not a "ripping" expert, you can
  simply accept the default settings, but if you are an expert, you can change
  settings or create a new predefined output target. It's also perfect if
  someone you know needs to rip content because it hides from them all the
  complexity. If you need to copy content from DVDs, <strong>please</strong>
  try OGMRip.</p>

  <h2>Bug fixes</h2>

  <p>The following table gives you a overview of activity on bugs and feature
  requests as at FIXME. In each cell of the table is a link to a detailed list
  of the relevant bugs or feature requests.</p>
