<p>
    Here's a selection of events which occurred since the previous newsletter:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <h3>Happy birthday to Gimmix</h3>
        <p><a href="http://gimmix.berlios.de/">Gimmix</a> - the excellent MPD GUI client - turned 2 years old on 26 September 2008 and to celebrate its author released version 0.5.0.  For those that don't know, Gimmix's author is also a member of the Frugalware development team - Priyank!</p>
    </li>

        <h3>Frugalware joins the art world</h3>
        <p>Most Linux users want their distribution to look good - ranging from startup screen, login screen to wallpaper and icons.  Imagining how you want your desktop to look is usually easy.  Turning these dreams into reality is much more difficult.  There are at least two problems here:<p>
        <ol>
            <li>everyone likes different artwork - some people liking a minimalistic look, while others want a desktop filled with "eye candy";</li>
            <li>geeks don't usually make good artists because they're are usually logically-minded and not artistic.</li>
        </ol>

        <p>Devil505 has been busy recently, working on these problems for the benefit of Frugalware.  He's put together an art team and established two new web sites devoted to Frugalware art.  The <a href="http://frugalware.org/~devil505/artwork10/">web site</a> for official  Frugalware artwork team already includes some great wallpapers, Splashy themes and GDM themes.  <a href="http://frugalware-art.org">frugalware-art.org</a> hosts general Frugalware artwork, to which everyone can upload their work.  One exciting item created by the artwork team is an SVG version of the Frugalware logo.  Why is this so exciting?  Because we can now create wallpapers etc in various sizes and have the Frugalware logo scaled to match.</p>
        <p>Everyone's welcome to join the artwork team and contribute their work.  Even if you aren't an artist you can help the team by telling them what you do and don't like about their work.  Getting feedback from Frugalware's users is very helpful because it helps guide the artwork's development.  Personally I quite like some of Leo's work because it's a little more <em>interesting</em> than most distribution's artwork.</p>

<a name=""><h2>Feature Article - Give a somatic look to your Frugalware - by Devil505</h2></a>

    <p>Somatic is an original artwork theme created by <a href="http://dlanham.com/">David Lanham</a>. One day a French Ubuntu user - <a href="http://www.mibhouse.org/pokemon_jojo/Pokemon_jojo">Pokemon_jojo</a> - made an icon theme for the Gnome desktop, themes for GDM and backgrounds based on Lanham's drawings.  I found this artwork very nice with its "cartoonish" style and I decided to package it for Frugalware Linux.</p>

    <p>To install the icon theme:</p>
    <p><pre># pacman-g2 -S somatic-icon-theme</pre></p>

    <p>Then choose it in gnome->appearance->properties.</p>
    <p>Preview: <a href="http://www.zimagez.com/zimage/preview-somatic.php">http://www.zimagez.com/zimage/preview-somatic.php</a></p>

    <p>To install the GDM themes:
    <p><pre># pacman-g2 -S somatic-gdm-themes</pre></p>

    <p>Start gdmsetup and select one of these themes.</p>
    <p>Preview: <a href="http://www.zimagez.com/zimage/somatic-gdm.php">http://www.zimagez.com/zimage/somatic-gdm.php</a></p>

    <p>To install Somatic wallpapers</p>
    <p><pre># pacman-g2 -S somatic-backgrounds</pre></p>

    <p>Files are located in /usr/share/pixmaps/backgrounds/somatic.  Preview: <a href="http://www.zimagez.com/zimage/bureau-somatic-wall.php">http://www.zimagez.com/zimage/bureau-somatic-wall.php</a></p>

    <p>Now your Frugalware has a "somatic" look :-)</p>


<a name="gettingtoknowyou"><h2>Getting To Know You</h2></a>

    <p>In this section of the newsletter, we get to know Frugalware Linux a little at a time. This is not meant to replace the official documentation but instead present it in a different way. It should also suit those people who, like me, have short attention spans. :)</p>

    <h3>pacman-g2 - new and old configuration files</h3>
    <p>When pacman-g2 is removing a package, it will usually leave any configuration files behind with a extension ".pacsave".  When it's finished installing a new package, pacman-g2 will usually leave the original configuration files but rename them with an extension of ".pacnew".  The contents of ".pacnew" files should be manually merged into the existing version.</p>


<a name="tips"><h2>Tips and tricks</h2></a>

<ul>
    <li>
        <h3>mutt - local and original timezone filter - submitted by VMiklos</h3>
        <p>VMiklos created a filter in mutt, so that he can always see the date of emails in local time and in the original timezone as well.  For example, he can see "this mail was sent 2 mins ago" and also "for the sender, this was early morning".</p>
        <p>The filter - written in Python - can be found <a href="http://git.frugalware.org/repos/vmexam/python/mutt/display-filter.py">here</a>.  It also contains two small filters to avoid some inline ads (sourceforge adds such ads and also an Hungarian site).  To use this filter you need to:
        <ol>
            <li>save it to ~/.mutt</li>
            <li>add 'set display_filter="$HOME/.mutt/display-filter.py"' in ~/.mutt/muttrc</li>
        </ol></p>
   </li>
</ul>
    <p>This section relies on your contributions! If have some tips and tricks that you would like to be shown in the newsletter, <b><u><i>please</i></u></b> post them on the forums.</p>


<a name="packages"><h2>Focus On Package(s)</h2></a>

    <h3><href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cowsay">Cowsay</href></h3>
        <p>This is a utility written in Perl 5 that has just one purpose - to add a little fun to your terminal.  At the command line you enter <pre>cowsay "text"</pre> and in ASCII art, the picture of a cow appears, with the text you specified appearing in a speech bubble.  It's hard to explain in words, so here's an example:</p>
        <p><pre>
 --------------------------------------
/ Lady Luck brings added income today. \
\ Lady friend takes it away tonight.   /
 --------------------------------------
 \   ^__^
  \  (oo)\_______
     (__)\       )\/\
         ||----w |
         ||     ||
        </pre></p>
        <p>Of course having a cow saying the same thing every time could get boring.  To solve this you can combine fortune with cowsay to get a random saying from the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fortune_(Unix)">fortune</a> sayings database(s).  The command for this is: <pre>fortune | cowsay</pre>  Fortune has many options, including:
        <ul>
            <li>setting a maximum fortune length</li>
            <li>specifying a weighting on from which database the fortune is selected</li>
            <li>replacing the cow with anotehr animal - including a pengin!</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Why not try it out soon and have some fun?</p>
