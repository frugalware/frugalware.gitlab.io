  <p>Here is a selection of recent events and other items that you might find
  interesting:</p>

  <h3>Frugalware 1.4 pre-release 2 is available</h3>

  <p>On 13 December 2010, VMiklos released the latest pre-release of Frugalware
  1.4 . These pre-releases are a snapshot in time to be used for testing. The
  aim is to ensure that no major bugs exist, something which can be difficult
  with packages changing often in the 'current' package repository. If you have
  the bandwidth and time available, <em>please</em> test this release. The more
  bugs we find now, the better will be the final release. Bugs include not only
  packages, but translations, documentation and the installer. If you find
  anything, please report it in the <a href="http://bugs.frugalware.org/">Bug
  Tracker system</a>.</p>

  <h3>Priyank returns...</h3>

  <p>Frugalware developer Priyank took a break from his favourite Linux
  distribution for a little over a year. He is the maintainer of many packages,
  also the creator of GFpm (a graphical package manager) and FUN (Frugalware
  Update Notifier). Yes, he literally put the FUN into Frugalware! As soon as
  he returned, he was committing changes to various packages, including many
  related to Xfce. Priyank, welcome back!</p>

  <h3>Xfce 4.8 is on its way</h3>

  <p>The Xfce development team are hard at work, preparing for the release of
  4.8, due in January 2011. They have already made significant improvements,
  including complete rewrites of the menu, and adding support for remote,
  shared directories. So that Xfce users can experience and test version 4.8,
  the team have released Xfce 4.8 pre-release 2. Although it's marked as a
  pre-release, it already features much of the extra functionality planned for
  4.8. Thanks to Frugalware developer Devil505, you can easily install this
  release from a work in progress (WIP) repository. Refer to <a href=
  "http://frugalware.org/people/devil505/blog">his</a> blog entry for further
  details.</p>

  <p>If you don't already know what a WIP repository is, an explanation is
  featured in newsletter issue <a href=
  "http://frugalware.org/newsletter/issue45">45</a>.</p>

  <h3>We are moving</h3>

  <p>Frugalware started when VMiklos released 0.1 in November 2010. In the
  early days there were only a few developers and contributors, so we found
  accommodation in VMiklos' parents' garage. As the team grew though, we had to
  fit more people into a tiny space. At first it wasn't too bad because all we
  had to do was remove the cubicle walls to get more space. Soon even that
  wasn't enough and we finally got permission to move the car. Today everyone
  has a chair and is restricted to a 10-inch netbook, with agreement that
  everyone keeps their elbows at their side while typing. The growing number of
  developers and contributors, together with the increasing noise, power costs
  and the fact that the local donut and coffee shop closed, has meant that we
  had to move elsewhere. We have bought a building, named it the Frugal-plex
  (the letter <em>u</em> has a long <em>ooo</em> sound here) and placed a large
  sculpture in the shape of the Frugalware logo out the front for everyone to
  see. The new accommodation is great, with everyone having a large cubicle,
  also free soft drink provided and large lounge areas in which everyone can
  take a break when they need one. If you are ever in the area, please visit
  because we'd love to show you around.</p>

  <h3>Please help with newsletter translations</h3>

  <p>Translations of the newsletter into French and Danish may not be available
  for every issue. Those who would normally provide the translation simply
  don't have the time at the moment. Apologies to those who read French or
  Danish but as I'm sure you understand, all work done in supporting Frugalware
  is done on a volunteer basis. Speaking of which, if anyone is willing and
  able to translate the newsletter, please send an email to the Frugalware
  developers' mailing list. Your fellow French or Danish speakers would be
  grateful, I'm sure.</p>

  Frugalware's users are people too!</h2>

  <p>This is the latest in the ongoing series of interviews with Frugalware's
  users. Even though we have at least one thing in common - our use of
  Frugalware - everyone has a different, interesting story to tell.</p>

  <dl>
    <dt><strong>What's your name?</strong></dt>

    <dd>
      <p>Paolo Cretaro.</p>
    </dd>

    <dt><strong>What's your IRC/forum nickname?</strong></dt>

    <dd>
      <p>Usually Melko.</p>
    </dd>

    <dt><strong>In what country do you live?</strong></dt>

    <dd>
      <p>I live in Italy (for now).</p>
    </dd>

    <dt><strong>What operating system(s) did you use before FW ?</strong></dt>

    <dd>
      <p>Before 2009 Windows, then I tried several GNU/Linux distros like
      OpenSuse, Mandriva, Debian, Archlinux, Ubuntu, Pardus, Dreamlinux,
      Scientific Linux. I actually have a netbook with Frugalware, Sabayon and
      Slackware.</p>
    </dd>

    <dt><strong>When did you start to use Linux (Frugalware)?</strong></dt>

    <dd>
      <p>I installed my first distro in 2009, before that I only used live CD
      (like Knoppix) because I was too young to mess up with my parents' PC.
      Instead I started with Frugalware some months ago, in April-March
      2010.</p>
    </dd>

    <dt><strong>What do you like most about Frugalware?</strong></dt>

    <dd>
      <p>First of all the name, I used to define myself a frugal person, so we
      make a good couple. It's simple, it's fast and it has a rolling release
      tree, what more do you want?</p>
    </dd>

    <dt><strong>What would you like to see changed in Frugalware?</strong></dt>

    <dd>
      <p>Mhm hard question. I like Frugalware as it is now, however I think
      that it would be great to see more people contributing to this
      project.</p>
    </dd>

    <dt><strong>Do you do anything to spread knowledge of
    Frugalware?</strong></dt>

    <dd>
      <p>Not enough. Here Windows rules, so it's not easy to open peoples' eyes
      to free software.</p>
    </dd>

    <dt><strong>For what purpose(s) do you use Frugalware?</strong></dt>

    <dd>
      <p>For everything, from gaming to physical computations.</p>
    </dd>

    <dt><strong>How did you find Frugalware - e.g. a friend/Google
    search?</strong></dt>

    <dd>
      <p>As you can see I tried several distros. One day a friend told me:
      "Hey, what about trying Frugalware? I've never tried it but I've heard
      good things about it.", so I thought "Why not?" and here I am.</p>
    </dd>

    <dt><strong>What do you do when you're not using Frugalware?</strong></dt>

    <dd>
      <p>I mainly study physics, but also play guitar and take pictures,
      sometimes I also post them on flickr.</p>
    </dd>

    <dt><strong>Please show us a screenshot of your desktop(s)</strong></dt>

    <dd>
      <p>My desktop has nothing special, I'm not a big fan of appearance.</p>

  <p><strong>Disclaimer</strong> - Be aware that the hints &amp; tips provided
  here have NOT been tested and so come with no warranty.</p>

  <h3>Colour your <em>man</em> output</h3>

  <p>most is an output pager which has more sophisticated options than other
  common pagers such as <em>less</em> and <em>more</em>. One of its features is
  that it can apply colour to output of the <em>man</em> command. In the
  default configuration, text which would normally be underlined appears in a
  light green colour, while switches appear in red. The colours used by
  <em>most</em> are easily changed. You can see for yourself what the output
  looks like with the command <em>man most | most</em>. If you want to use
  <em>most</em> as your default pager, add the following line to your .bashrc
  file:</p>

  <p><tt>PAGER=/usr/bin/most</tt></p>

  <p>This section relies on your contributions! If you have some tips and
  tricks that you would like to be shown in the newsletter, <em>please</em>
  post them on the forums.</p>

  "left">Focus on Package(s)</h2>

  <h3>autojump</h3>

  <p>Thanks to Frugalware contributor Fabien, we have a very useful utility
  added to Frugalware. This is one of those applications which, when I read its
  description, made me think, "Why hasn't anyone created this before?" <a href=
  "http://github.com/joelthelion/autojump">autojump</a> is a command-line
  utility which allows you to easily cd or <em>jump</em> to a directory you
  have been to before. The difference between using <em>cd</em> and autojump is
  that you only need to give autojump part of the destination directory's name,
  which saves time and hassle. If you often <em>cd</em> to the directory
  containing your MP3 files, for example, you might enter <tt>j mp3</tt> and
  you would then be in that directory. If you had visited more than one folder
  which contained the letters <em>mp3</em>, autojump would take you to the one
  which you had visited most. It also features an auto-completion feature so
  you can enter <em>mp3</em> and press [Tab] and it will either complete the
  directory's name if there is just one match, or show you a list of those
  which match your criteria. It even handles removable media because if the
  media is not available when you use autojump, any matches on the removable
  media are ignored.</p>

  <p>autojump doesn't interfere with the <em>cd</em> command's normal operation
  so you can choose between the two. If you want to get to somewhere you have
  been before, you can use autojump, otherwise use <em>cd</em>. If you need to
  go back there later, autojump can take you there quickly and easily. Try it
  and see for yourself how much time this little utility saves you.</p>

  <h3>ncdu</h3>

  <p>There never seems to be quite enough storage space to store all that you
  want to. Often it's a surprise when you find that a partition is nearly full.
  The du' utility is an excellent tool which gives you total disk space used by
  all subdirectories and their subdirectories. To find out just where disk
  space is being used, you often need to navigate through the file system and
  although you could do this with du, it's really not the best tool for the
  job. *ncdu*, an Ncurses-based utility, is perfect for this task. When you
  start it, ncdu analyses the storage usage in the current directory (assuming
  one hasn't been specified at the command line) and shows the storage usage of
  each sub-directory in both a percentage and bar display. If you want to
  investigate a specific directory, you simply move the highlight bar to it and
  press [Enter] and ncdu then displays the storage usage statistics for its
  sub-directories. You can move either up or down the file system, seeing at a
  glance which directories are using the most disk space. By default, each
  directory is listed in descending order by disk space usage but you can
  switch to sorting by name, and back again. If you find files or directories
  that you want to delete, ncdu allows you to do that. It even provides
  statistics on the actual disk space occupied by a file or directory, which is
  usually greater than the total size of a file or folder and its contents. As
  with the sorting option, you can switch the display between 'apparent' disk
  space and actual disk space usage.</p>

  <p>Like many utilities of its type, ncdu does precisely what its developer
  says it does and does it very well. Thanks to Pingax for finding and
  packaging such a useful application.</p><a href=
