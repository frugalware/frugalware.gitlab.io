<p>Features of this issue include:
    <ul>
        <li>Frugalware 1.0 pre2 is released</li>
        <li>Elentir's officially a developer!</li>
        <li>Frugalware's users are people too - juky</li>

</p>


<a name="events"><h2>Events</h2></a>

<p>Here's a selection of events which have occurred since the previous newsletter:</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        <h3>Parlez-vous français?</h3>
        <p>Soon after the release of newsletter issue 37, Devil505 said that I had missed translating just one word - "humour".  I looked at where the word was used and was sure it was correct.  I learned then that this word has the same spelling and meaning in both English and French.  Many French words are commonly used in modern spoken and written English, so it shouldn't have surprised me, but it did!</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h3>Xfce 4.6 work continues</h3>
        <p>Work on Xfce 4.6 continues, with the development team continuing to release beta versions.  This is great news for Xfce users, but it means more work for Priyank.  :(  He's been kept busy packaging the latest beta version - 4.5.93.  These packages are maintained in a separate repository which must be added manually to pacman's repository list.  If you want to test these packages, follow the instructions in newsletter issue FIXME on how to get these packages with pacman-g2.  Since the release and the repository are beta, be prepared for bugs.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h3>It seemed like a good idea at the time :)</h3>
        <p>When I thought of the Frugalware developer questions, I thought it would be interesting to know where people lived and where they were born.  I'm Australian and a large percentage of those living in Australia were born in other countries.  Unfortunately every other Frugalware developer, contributor and user who has replied to the interview questions was born in the country that they live in.  I had thought about removing the question "In what country were you born?" but I'm still hoping that someone will give a different answer to everyone else.  Anyone?</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h3>Elentir's officially a developer!</h3>
        <p>Elentir has created several FrugalBuilds, and is developing Fwife, the Frugalware GUI installer (which is undergoing heavy development).  VMiklos recently proposed on the developers' mailing list that he become an official developer.  Soon after this was proposed, the developers voted and agreed that Elentir become an official developer so congratulations to him.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h3>"Many hands make light work"</h3>
        <p>Now that Elentir is officially a developer, this will ease the load of other developers, particularly the French developers.  Office duties assigned to each member of the "French development team" have been reviewed and the following has been proposed:</a></p>
        <p>
            <ul>
                <li>Hermier - accommodation</li>
                <li>Bouleetbil - coffee</li>
                <li>Devil505 - entertainment (games, mainly Pac Man)</li>
                <li>gholafox - donuts</li>
                <li>Elentir - lunches</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h3>Frugalware 1.0 pre2 is released</h3>
        <p>On 13 January 2009, VMiklos <a href="http://www.frugalware.org/news/123">announced</a> the release of Frugalware 1.0 pre2.  It's exciting that we're getting closer to the final release of 1.0 and amazing that this release includes 100 new packages and 800 updates/bug fixes.  Well done to the development team.  If you have the bandwidth and time available, please download and test this release.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h3>Death to developers? :P</h3>
        <p>This is quite old news, but it's interesting.  On 18 December 2008, the following was said in the #frugalware IRC channel:</p>
        <p>
            <code>
            &lt <strong>olegfink</strong>&gt   thanks a lot, that's something I really missed with archlinux -- ability to bug developers to death with silly stuff :-P<br />
            &lt <strong>vmiklos</strong> &gt   :)<br />
            &lt <strong>rafaelmartins</strong> &gt   I agree with olegfink :P
            </code>
        </p>
        <p>If I understood this conversation correctly, it was definitely <strong>not</strong> meant as a death threat.  Instead olegfink was grateful for the ability to talk directly with developers, even about minor things.  I'm also grateful for this; in fact it's one thing that makes Frugalware different from other distributions.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h3>It's "hats off" to Devil505</h3>
        <p>It was once traditional in the Western world to take your hat off when you met someone, as a sign of your respect for them.  I take my hat off to Devil505 for the Frugalware Christmas and New Year images he provided.  I was a little worried when I first saw the New Year logo because the hat looked like a "fedora".  Devil505 said that it certainly <strong>wasn't</strong> a fedora and that next time he would probably use a red hat.  :P</p>
    </li>
</ul>

<a name="upgrades"><h2>Upgrades</h2></a>

<p>Here's a selection of packages which have been upgraded since the previous newsletter:</p>

<a name="gettingtoknowyou"><h2>Getting To Know You</h2></a>

    <p>In this section of the newsletter, we get to know Frugalware Linux a little at a time.  This is not meant to replace the official documentation but instead make it easier to read.  This should suit those those people who, like me, have short attention spans.  :)</p>

    <h3>SHA-1 hash</h3>
    <p>Every Frugalware package has a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sha-1">SHA1 hash</a> which is used to validate its integrity when it's downloaded.  Before installing a package, pacman-g2 checks its SHA1 hash against the package database.  If it fails the integrity test, pacman-g2 will tell you and offer to delete the package.  This feature avoids corrupt files being installed, saving you time you might spend troubleshooting an executable with just one corrupt bit.</p>

    <li>
        <h3>W3C Markup Validation Service</h3>
        <p>The W3C offers a <a href="http://validator.w3.org/">markup validation service</a> which checks the markup validity  of Web documents in HTML, XHTML, SMIL, MathML, etc.  At this site you can provide the URL of the document to be validated, upload a file containing the document, or paste the contents of the document.  The service then presents a report which confirms whether or not the content provided is valid.  If it's not valid it provides details as to where the content has problems.</p>

        <h3>If you're ugly, you need to read this...</h3>
        <p>Do people sometimes cross the street to avoid you, or offer you a paper bag to put over your head?  Read on for a practical solution to this problem.  To look more attractive, you could have cosmetic surgery but it's expensive and honestly, the results might not be too good.  Here's a cheaper and easier solution - put a good-looking wallpaper on your PC.  If you then hold your PC's monitor in front of your head you're instantly more attractive!  Note that this works best if your PC is a laptop, otherwise you need to either (1) buy a very long power cord, or (2) stay in your room.</p>
        <p>Remember:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>the wallpaper should be chosen based on its attractiveness to other people, <strong>not</strong> yourself;</li>
            <li>wallpapers featuring movie stars are <strong>NOT</strong> recommended because these will bring you too much attention, mainly from paparazzi;</li>
            <li>you should measure the size of your monitor so you can be sure it matches the size of your head;</li>
            <li>you <strong>must</strong> enable the X server's Composite extension to enable transparency, so that you can see through the wallpaper.  If you don't do this, you will not be able to see where you're walking.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The following are a few sites from where you can get attractive wallpapers:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="http://www.digitalblasphemy.com">Digital Blasphemy</a></li>
            <li><a href="http://www.kde-look.org">KDE Look</a></li>
            <li><a href="http://www.gnome-look.org">Gnome Look</a></li>
            <li><a href="http://gucken.deviantart.com/gallery/">Gucken's gallery at Deviant Art</a></li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>DISCLAIMER:</strong>  Individual results may vary and are dependent upon your selection of wallpaper.  Frugalware is not responsible for any actions which result from following the above advice.</p>

<a name="packages"><h2>Focus On Package(s)</h2></a>

    <h3>dkopp</h3>
        <p>"dkopp is a free open source Linux program used to copy or back-up disk files to DVD. Full or incremental backups can be done, with full or incremental DVD verification. A GUI is used to navigate through directories to select or de-select files or directories at any level. Backup jobs can be saved for later re-use. New, deleted, and updated disk files are handled automatically, without re-editing the backup job. An incremental backup updates the same DVD used for a prior full backup. Files can be restored to the same or another location on disk. Large backup jobs can be done using multiple DVD media."</p>
