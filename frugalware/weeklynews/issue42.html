<p><h2>Frugalware Linux Newsletter - Issue 42</h2></p>

<p><h2>...to inform...to educate...to entertain</h2></p>

<p>There are 10 types of people in the world - those who understand binary and
those who don't. - <em>A geek</em></p>


<h2>Welcome</h2>

<p>The newsletter's aim is to keep you up to date with what's happened recently
in the world of the Linux distribution 'Frugalware'.</p>

<p>Features of this issue include:
    <ul>
        <li>To infinity...and beyond</li>
        <li>Will the <em>real</em> Cedric(k) please stand up?</li>
        <li>Frugalware's developers are people too - VMiklos</li>
        <li>Tips and tricks - Unlucky in love?</li>
        <li>Focus On Package(s) - lsof</li>
    </ul>
</p>


<h2>Events</h2>

<p>Here's a selection of events which have occurred since the previous
newsletter:</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        <h3>To infinity...and beyond</h3>
        <p>26 March 2009, VMiklos announced the codename for the next Frugalware
        release - 1.1 -  "Getorin".  It's exciting to try and guess what might
        be included in the next release.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h3>Will the <em>real</em> Cedric(k) please stand up?</h3>
        <p>In an event that was sure to happen at some point, we have a
        developer and contributor with very similar first names - Cedrick
        Hannier and CÃ©dric Archambeau.  The following options have been proposed
        to avoid any confusion between the two Cedric(k)s:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Each Cedric(k) could wear a name tag, with their full name clearly
        marked.  Of course someone has already pointed out that this is a stupid
        option because unless you live in France, they'd be so far away that you
        couldn't read the name tag;</li>
        <li>One of the Cedric(k)s could change their name.  This is perhaps the
        simplest option, but neither Cedric(k) seems to like the idea;</li>
        <li>Each developer or contributor could be assigned a unique,
        sequential number.  This has already been discussed amongst the
        development team, but no-one could agree on if the numbering should
        start from 0 or 1.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>I hope we can come up with a solution by the next newsletter.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h3>Gnome 2.26</h3>
        <p>On 25 March 2009, Bouleetbil made available - via the 'current'
        repo packages for Gnome 2.26.  Thanks to him for his hard work.  Gnome
        consists of a lot of packages and it's a difficult and time consuming
        job to get it all done.</p>
    </li>
</ul>

<h2>Frugalware's developers are people too - VMiklos</h2>

<p>In this issue we have a very special interview with VMiklos, the founder of
Frugalware Linux.  I thought it would be interesting to have him look back on
the past 5 years and to the future.</p>

<dl>
    <dt><strong>What were your goals when you started the Frugalware project?
    </strong></dt>
        <dd><p>I had to search back, I could only remember that there were
        three goals. Here they are:</p></dd>
        <ul>
            <li>A fast package manager, written in C (versus Slackware's
            pkgtool which was slow and was written in bash);</li>
            <li>I18n support (Slackware's setup was not localised);</li>
            <li>Smooth upgrades between stable releases (at that time there
            was no slapt-get and upgrades were a PITA);</li>
        </ul></dd>
<br>
    <dt><strong>Do you think you've achieved any of these goals?</strong></dt>

        <dd><p>Sure:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The original problem with slow package removals were never the
            case with pacman;</li>
            <li>I18n support is everywhere, we have 10 localised projects on
            Pootle;</li>
            <li>We recently introduced upgrade HOWTO, so the change between
            stable versions is pretty smooth. Actually it must be, since most
            of the devs administer multiple Frugalware machines. :)</li></dd>
        </ul>
<br>
    <dt><strong>Have your goals changed and if so, how?</strong></dt>

        <dd><p>We always reach goals and accordingly set new ones. I remember
        a fast installer was a goal before 0.3, a tool like repoman (to make
        installing blobs like opera or skype easy) was something users wanted,
        the automatic package builder was a collection of scripts we really
        loved when it was introduced, etc. I remember the first time the
        installer supported the WPA encryption via wireless and we were quite
        happy. :)</p>

        <p>Anyway we have implicitly reached some goals, like trying to be
        nice to users, respecting users' decisions, having a fully documented
        and as-open-as-possible infrastructure, and this seems to be unchanged
        during several releases. (Yes, I stole this list from LGee, as he
        collected this stuff floating around. :) )</p></dd>

    <dt><strong>Do you plan a career in IT and if so, do you think your work on
    Frugalware will help you?</strong></dt>

        <dd><p>I already work part-time and have already solved many problems
        at work which would not have been possible without Frugalware. Random
        example: we have used Git and Pootle for a long time and when we wanted
        to give it a try at work, I was able to help with that, since I already
        know them quite well.</p></dd>

    <dt><strong>In what areas would you like to see Frugalware improved?
    </strong></dt>
        <dd><p>On the one hand, Frugalware is already in the shape I think an
        ideal distribution should look be, so I don't think we will radically
        change anything in the near future.</p>

        <p>On the other hand, we have many smaller targets, for example smaller
        packages (lzma support), better error handling in the installer, etc.</p></dd>

        <dt><strong>Do you have all the support you would like, or do you want
        more developers and contributors?</strong></dt>

        <dd><p>Currently I maintain 670 packages. This is way too much. I
        think in an ideal world a developer should maintain about 100-200
        packages. So more developers would be nice, though I think we're moving
        in that direction, we got 4 new developers in 2008, and we already
        have two new developers this year as well.</p></dd>

    <dt><strong>Can you give a summary of your experience over the past 5 years?
    </strong></dt>

        <dd><p>Lots of funny and instructive stories. :) Other than that,
        running The Perfect distro on my boxes really makes me pleased (and I
        do not mean bug-free, there are bugs, but all the concepts are the way
        I like it), and I have met numerous great developers and users here.
        </p></dd>

    <dt><strong>Do you see Frugalware having a long life?</strong></dt>

        <dd><p>I really don't see what could stop us. :) Also a few of us
        (devels) are more-or-less paid to work on Frugalware (maintain
        installed systems) and so we have the ability to use it in a
        production environment which is yet another reason not to stop
        development.</p></dd>

    <dt><strong>Do you think Frugalware would continue if you left the project?
    </strong></dt>

        <dd><p>Frugalware is my pet, and during the past 5 years, I got a lot
        of practice in doing project leadership stuff (resolving personal
        conflicts, release-engineering, etc.), so in case somebody else would
        want to do it, it would take a while to hand him everything over. But
        ideally everything is documented and I think it's possible that one
        day we meet somebody who has more time or better skills than me, and
        I won't hesitate to step back in that case. I'm already proud of what
        we have achieved with this great team.</p></dd>

    <dt><strong>What's the view from your front door?</strong></dt>

        <dd><p>I'm sure I provided a photo of the view from my front door in
        issue 16. Since the view changes from season to season though, here's
        the current view. <img src="vmiklos_house2.jpg" alt="View from VMiklos

<h2>Getting To Know You</h2>

<p>In this section of the newsletter, we get to know Frugalware Linux a little
at a time.  This is not meant to replace the official documentation but instead
make it easier to read.  This should suit those those people who, like me, have
short attention spans.  :)</p>

<h3>What's going on?</h3>

<p>One of the best ways of finding out what's happening with Frugalware is to
subscribe to one or more of the mailing lists. Here you can read the
discussions behind the various decisions that are made regarding Frugalware.
There's also a mailing list which announces the security fixes as they are
released. Review the mailing lists available
<a href="http://frugalware.org/mailman/listinfo">here</a> and subscribe to
those that interest you.</p>


<h2>Tips and tricks</h2>

<p><b>Disclaimer</b> - Be aware that the hints &amp; tips provided here have NOT
been tested and so come with no warranty.</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        <h3>Free Linux Magazine</h3>

        <p><a href="http://www.linux-magazine.com">Linux Magazine</a> is available for
        free in PDF format. Parts of each issue are available a few weeks
        after the issue was available in printed form, and the remaining
        articles are added until the complete issue is available, usually 4
        months after it was available in printed form. Linux Magazine is an
        excellent magazine which covers a broad range of Linux-related topics
        and has articles which suit people from newbie to experienced Linux
        users.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h3>Unlucky in love?</h3>
        <p>If you find that you're unlucky in love, it just might be you that's
        the problem. Some people aren't attracted to geeks but don't worry,
        because here's <strong>one</strong> way to improve your chances of
        finding "true love". Find people that are much geekier than you and,
        when the person to whom you're attracted sees you with them, you'll
        actually appear normal and so more attractive! The key to success is
        finding the right people. The type of people that you need to look
        for:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Use vi, Emacs or - even better - <strong>both</strong>;</li>
            <li>Wear a binary watch and are proud to do so;</li>
            <li>Calculate their age according to the Unix epoch.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>You don't have to actually like these people; it's good enough to
        pretend. At the right moment, provoke a discussion about which is the
        best editor - vi or Emacs.  You must appear utterly confused, or this
        technique will fail. Remember that you must <strong>NOT</strong>
        contribute to the discussion.</p>
        <p>Good luck and "May the Force be with you".</p>
    </li>
</ul>

<p>This section relies on your contributions! If have some tips and tricks that
you would like to be shown in the newsletter, <em>please</em> post them on the
forums.</p>


<h2>Focus On Package(s)</h2>

<h3>lsof</h3>

<p>"Lsof is a Unix-specific diagnostic tool. Its name stands for LiSt Open Files,
and it does just that. It lists information about any files that are open by
processes currently running on the system. It can also list communications open
by each process."</p>

<p>lsof is more useful than you might first think because, in UNIX, everything
is a file. It's extremely useful, for example, when you know some process has a
file open but it's not obvious just which process has it open. For some great
examples of what it can be used for, refer to
<a href="http://dmiessler.com/study/lsof/">this page</a>.
