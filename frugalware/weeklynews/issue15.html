<h2>Events</h2>
<p>
    Here's a selection of events which have occurred since the previous newsletter:

    <h3>Kalgan - we're getting closer :)</h3>
        <p>On 29 January 2008, vmiklos announced the release of Frugalware 0.8 ("Kalgan") release candidate 1.  Included in this release are quite a number of bug fixes, updated packages and new packages.  For more details on this exciting release, read vmiklos' <a href="http://www.frugalware.org/news/86">announcement</a>.</p>
        <p>The purpose of Frugalware's pre-releases and release candidates is to allow anyone who's interested to test the work in progress.  If you have the bandwidth and time required to help, <b>please</b> test these pre-releases and release candidates.  The more bugs that are found during the testing phase, the better the quality of the final release.</p>
        <p>According to my calculations, there are only 902,334,167,372,827,123 trillion light years to go.  :)  (In reality it's closer to 6 weeks, according to the <a href="http://www.frugalware.org/roadmap">roadmap</a>).</p>

        <h3>Video problem? - don't panic - submitted by 'phayz'</h3>
        <p><b>Question</b> - Let's take a common configuration - you have configured Frugalware to boot to a GUI login manager - KDM, GDM or SLiM for example.  OK, now you've found on boot that X isn't working.  If you can't get into your graphical desktop environment, how can you edit /etc/xorg.conf to fix the problem?</p>
        <p><b>Answer</b></p>
            <ol>
                <li>When you see the graphical GRUB menu, press [Esc] and confirm that you want to exit from the graphical menu.  You'll now see the standard text-only GRUB menu. </li>
                <li>Highlight your preferred GRUB entry and press [E] (for 'Edit').</li>
                <li>Press [E] again and you're dropped into a basic editor.</li>
                <li>Press [End] to move the cursor to the end of the line.</li>
                <li>Press [3], then [Enter] to end editing the GRUB entry.</li>
                <li>Press [Enter] again to select the temporarily modified entry and GRUB will boot.  The "3" which you added to the end of the GRUB entry specifies run level '3', which means that Frugalware will boot into a text-only mode - i.e. X will not be started.</li>
                <li>Now you need to log in and, using a text-only editor (Vi, emacs, nano, pico, joe for example), correct your /etc/xorg.conf file.</li>
            </ol>
    </li>
</ul>
    <p>This section relies on your contributions! If you have some tips and tricks that you would like to be shown in the newsletter, <b><u><i>please</i></u></b> post them on the forums in the Tips and Tricks section!</p>


<a name="packages"</a>
<h2>Focus On Package(s)</h2>

    <p>In a new section of the newsletter, I focus on one or more packages and give a general overview of their features.  The packages featured will usually be the more obscure ones.  You're not likely to be reading about the major desktops.</p>
    <h3>Stellarium - gazing at the stars from your PC</h3>
        <p><a href="http://www.stellarium.org/">Stellarium</a> is an amazing application which is described on its home page as "a free open source planetarium for your computer. It shows a realistic sky in 3D, just like what you see with the naked eye, binoculars or a telescope."  If you have any interest in what's "up there", you simply <b>must</b> look at Stellarium.  The images it produces are just amazing and can be presented in a range of interesting ways.  It's a very active project, with the latest release on 17 January 2008.  Its system requirements are very reasonable so it can be used even on old PCs - a Pentium III for example.</p>

<h2>Security announcements</h2>
<p>
