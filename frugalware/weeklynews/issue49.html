  <h2>Frugalware Linux Newsletter - Issue 49</h2>

  <h2>...to inform...to educate...to entertain</h2>

  <blockquote>
    <p>"There are three sides of an argument -- your side, my side
    and the right side.."</p>
  </blockquote>

  <h2>Welcome</h2>

  <p>The newsletter's aim is to keep you up to date with what's
  happened recently in the world of the Linux distribution
  'Frugalware'.</p>

  <p>Features of this issue include:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Elentir released fwife 0.5</li>

    <li>Frugalware 1.1 release party plans continue</li>

    <li>Frugalware's developers are people too - Exceed</li>

    <li>Focus On Package(s) - ufw and gufw</li>
  </ul>


  <h2>Events</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <h3>Kernel vulnerability</h3>

      <p>There is a "local root" exploit for the kernel currently
      in the 'current' repository - refer <a href=
      "http://lists.immunitysec.com/pipermail/dailydave/2009-July/005810.html">
      here</a> for details. The vulnerability, if exploited, could
      allow a local user to get root privileges. No FSA has been
      released because:</p>

      <ol>
        <li>2.6.30 is in -current, not in -stable;</li>

        <li>pulseaudio must installed to be vulnerable, but we
        don't have pulseaudio in our official repos.</li>
      </ol>

      <p>For those that are interested, the ID of the vulnerability
      is CVE-2009-1897 and the fix is <a href=
      "http://git.kernel.org/?p=linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux-2.6.git;a=commit;h=3c8a9c63d5fd738c261bd0ceece04d9c8357ca13">
      here</a>. If you're running a vulnerable kernel on systems
      other than Frugalware, you may want to fix this
      vulnerability. We'll will be waiting until upstream includes
      the fix in the next 2.6.30.x release.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <h3>Elentir released fwife 0.5</h3>

      <p>On 29 July 2009, Elentir released fwife 0.5, which
      features the following changes:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>DHCP research on networks;</li>

        <li>improved network configuration plugin;</li>

        <li>fixed unexpected reverse dependencies due to locale
        packages;</li>

        <li>minor bug fixes (ext4 formatting, ...).</li>
      </ul>

      <p>If you have the spare time and bandwidth available,
      <strong>please</strong> help by downloading a testing fwife.
      Elentir needs help in finding any bugs which remain. If can
      help, please go to the fwife development web page <a href=
      "http://utopia.toile-libre.org/fwife/cdinstall/">here</a>.</p>

      <p>If Elentir is married I hope that his wife understands
      that he sometimes needs to spend time with his "other" wife.
      Note: I realise that this "joke" only makes sense in English,
      and I hope you forgive me.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <h3>rhyhann's patched packages</h3>

      <p>Frugalware user rhyhann recently submitted patches for 13
      packages. As with all new developers, these patches are being
      reviewed, but will probably be committed soon. It's always
      exciting to see new contributions, and rhyhann's are very
      welcome. Perhaps soon he/she might become an official
      developer.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <h3>Frugalware 1.1 release party plans continue</h3>

      <p>In newsletter issue 44 I announced that plans were
      underway for the 1.1 release party. Food is always an
      important part of any successful party, so we're putting a
      lot of time and effort into the menu. We thought it was
      important that an international project's release party had
      an international menu, so a vote was held and the most
      popular food and drinks were chosen. 1.1's release is
      scheduled for 1 September 2009 and the menu may change
      between now and then, but for the moment, here it is:</p>

      <p><strong>Entreé</strong></p>

      <ul>
        <li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frog_legs">Frogs'
        legs in garlic butter sauce</a></li>

        "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goulash">Goulash</a></li>

        <li>Kangaroo steaks, served with roast potato and gravy</li>
      </ul>

      <p><strong>Dessert</strong></p>

      </ul>

      <p><strong>Drinks</strong></p>

        <li>Beer</li>
      </ul>
    </li>

  </ul>

  <h2>Frugalware's developers are people too</h2>

  <p>You may have noticed that newsletter issue 48 didn't have an
  interview section. Unfortunately no interview was available to be
  published. For this issue, though, we have an interview with one
  of our most recent new developers - Exceed. Many thanks to him
  for agreeing to answer the interview questions.</p>

  <dl>
    <dt><strong>What's your name?</strong></dt>

    <dd>
      <p>Cédric Archambeau</p>
    </dd>

    <dt><strong>What's your IRC nickname?</strong></dt>

    <dd>
      <p>Exceed</p>
    </dd>

    <dt><strong>In what country do you live?</strong></dt>

    <dd>
      <p>France, Bordeaux</p>
    </dd>

    <dt><strong>In what country were you born?</strong></dt>

    <dd>
      <p>France</p>
    </dd>

    <dt><strong>What do you like the most about where you live (the
    country and/or town/city)?</strong></dt>

    <dd>
      <p>I love it, but I don't know why. It's my city... It's a
      very beautiful city (lots of people say it), with the sea
      (beach with white sand) at 1 hour in car : Arcachon, Lacanau.
      Life in Bordeaux is sweet. I lived in Paris for 8 years (in
      order to work), it's beautiful to visit, awful to live.</p>
    </dd>

    <dt><strong>What do you do for the Frugalware
    project?</strong></dt>

    <dd>
      <p>I'm the maintainer for some packages, mainly forensics and
      music composing tools. And my best, but sometimes it's not
      enough ;-)</p>
    </dd>

    <dt><strong>What motivates you to work on
    Frugalware?</strong></dt>

    <dd>
      <p>So many things :</p>

      <ol>
        <li>The free software philosophy : I think you have to give
        as much as free software gives you, whatever technical
        skills you have;</li>

        <li>The Frugalware community : some GNU/Linux distributions
        are now so big that they drain some other OS's users with
        their egomania. Frugalware keeps this friendly and in the
        helpful spirit I'm looking for;</li>

        <li>Frugalware's developers : a very nice team where
        everyone seems to have a place, where everyone listens to
        everyone. Many of them have more than 24 hours in a day I
        think...or several brains !;</li>

        <li>Frugalware itself of course : it's fast and has a
        Slackware base. And pacman-g2 is a must have (only missing
        deltas updates now).</li>
      </ol>
    </dd>

    <dt><strong>What do you do when you're not working on
    Frugalware?</strong></dt>

    <dd>
      <p>I'm using it! I play music in a band, and try to
      concentrate when my wife says something important (about new
      clothes, new shoes...).</p>
    </dd>

    <dt><strong>What's the view from your front door?</strong></dt>

  <h2>Getting To Know You</h2>

  <p>In this section of the newsletter, we get to know Frugalware
  Linux a little at a time. This is not meant to replace the
  official documentation but instead make it easier to read. This
  should suit those those people who, like me, have short attention
  spans. :)</p>

  <h3>Frugalware's package file format</h3>

  <p>Frugalware's package files are simply tarred gzip files.
  Therefore if you want to unpack a package's file instead of
  installing it, you can simply rename it with an ".tar.gz"
  extension, then open it with your preferred archive manager. Using
  this method you can easily review a packages' contents - review
  shell scripts contained in it, for example.</p>

  <h2>Tips and tricks</h2>

  <p><b>Disclaimer</b> - Be aware that the hints &amp; tips
  provided here have NOT been tested and so come with no
  warranty.</p>

  <h3>alien</h3>

  <p>'alien' has nothing to do with creatures from other worlds.
  Instead, it's a utility which can convert a Linux distribution's
  package from one format into another. It supports packages in
  Slackware, Debian and RPM format. For Frugalware users, it's
  recommended that you use alien only to extract and examine a
  "foreign" package's contents. Installing a converted package is
  definitely <strong>NOT</strong> recommended. You could very
  easily cause big problems when using a software package that's
  not from a Frugalware repository. Manually installing artwork
  that has been extracted from a package in a foreign format should
  be OK.</p>

  <p>This section relies on your contributions! If have some tips
  and tricks that you would like to be shown in the newsletter,
  <em>please</em> post them on the forums.</p>

  <h2>Focus On Package(s)</h2>

  <h3>ufw</h3>

  <p><a href="https://launchpad.net/ufw">ufw</a> is a user-friendly
  command-line tool for administering an to ease iptables firewall
  configuration. Originally developed for Ubuntu, it has proven to
  be very popular and, thanks to jercel,
  has now been packaged for Frugalware. An iptables firewall's
  configuration is a series of commands contained in a text file.
  The commands can be daunting to anyone not already familiar with
  them, and so ufw was born. Below are some example ufw
  commands:</p>

  <p>To allow incoming TCP packets on port 53, the ufw command is
  :</p>
  <pre>
ufw allow 53/tcp
</pre>

  <p>You can also manage access by service name, as in the
  following example, which enables SSH:</p>
  <pre>
ufw deny ssh
</pre>

  <p>To make ufw even easier to use, there's also a GUI interface,
  named "gufw" (Graphical Uncomplicated Firewall). The command-line
  version is most useful in situations where you're not running a
  GUI interface - e.g. managing a firewall via SSH, or on a server.
  The GUI version is perhaps best used when managing a firewall on
  a desktop PC.</p>

  <h3>Specto</h3>

  <p>"<a href="http://specto.sourceforge.net/">Specto</a> is a
  desktop application that monitors for user-configured events,
  then notifies the user. For example, it can check for changes to
  a web page, new email messages and file changes. As the developer
  of Specto says, with it watching for events, you've got more time
  to spend on more interesting things.</p>

  <p>Specto is still in beta, but it's already very useful. The
  developer needs help with testing and other tasks, so if you're
  interested and able, please go to the web site and get in
  contact.</p>
