  <h2><img src="http://frugalware.org/images/newsletter/event.png" align=
  "left">Events etc</h2>

  <p>Here's a selection of recent events and other items that you might find
  interesting:</p>

  <h3>Busy, busy, busy with updates</h3>

  <p>Many of the developers are busy updating core packages and packages which
  depend upon them. You may not notice these changes but you certainly get the
  benefit in better performance, features and stability.</p>

  <p>Some of the recent work includes:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>bouleetbil is updating X.org to version 1.8.1, including udev
    support;</li>

    <li>bouleetbil is upgrading GNOME to 2.30.2;</li>

    <li>voroskoi has updated OpenSSL to version 1.0.0;</li>

    <li>gholafox has updated physfs to 2.0.1;</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Hola! ¿Habla usted español?</h3>

  <p>I admit that I can't speak Spanish, but luckily DarkNekros can and is
  willing to help translate Frugalware projects into Spanish. He/she recently
  sent a message to the developers' mailing list with news that work on
  translation had begun. Improvements in Frugalware's translation are always
  good news because this makes it available to more people than would otherwise
  be possible. Let's hope that DarkNekros continues with this because it's sure
  to be welcomed by all Spanish-speaking Frugalware users.</p>

  <h3>fwife becomes more beautiful</h3>

  <p>Elentir continues to improve fwife, the GUI Frugalware installer. If you
  think of fwife like a car, he's currently tuning the engine and polishing
  everything until it sparkles in the sunshine. Now...where did I put the
  keys!?</p>

  <h3>Bouleetbil's moved</h3>

  <p>Frugalware developer bouleetbil recently moved all his computers into new
  accommodation. In a recent <a href=
  "http://dors.frugalware.org/bouleetbil/?p=386">blog entry</a> he provided a
  photo of his new accommodation. I think you'll agree that it looks really
  nice, especially the captain's chair. In winter the computers actually help
  to keep the room warm, and in warmer months he simply opens the window to
  allow the heat out.</p>

  <p>When you compare this with the accommodation he had before, it's a
  fantastic improvement. In the photo below you can see a small plastic house
  with a green room, which was where bouleetbil previously did all his work for
  Frugalware. It's amazing to think he has been able to work so well under these
  conditions. In the past, all work had to stop when it rained, also when his
  daughter wanted to have a tea party! It's a great win for Frugalware.</p>

  <h2><img src="http://frugalware.org/images/newsletter/tip.png" align=
  "left">Tips and tricks</h2>

  <p><b>Disclaimer</b> - Be aware that the hints &amp; tips provided here have
  NOT been tested and so come with no warranty.</p>

  <h3>Do you multiboot?</h3>

  <p>A multiboot configuration, where you have several operating systems
  installed on the same computer, is very common. It's used most often when you
  want a choice between different operating systems - Linux and Windows, for
  example. There are also good reasons to set up a multiboot configuration with
  the same operating system, even the same Linux distribution. Examples include
  running two different releases of Frugalware, and being able to choose
  between a desktop installation and a multimedia server installation. You may
  be able to achieve the same result with just one installation of Frugalware,
  but maintaining separate installations means that changes to one don't affect
  the other. For reasons of stability, you might want to maintain the
  multimedia server on a stable Frugalware release, but keep up with the
  'current' repository on the PC, general-purpose installation. To create a
  multiboot installation you simply install Frugalware again to new partitions
  and add the appropriate lines to GRUB's configuration file. If you need help
  with this, please ask in the forums.</p>

  <h3>Display package updates with Conky (thanks to Lenezir)</h3>

  <p>In his interview, Frugalware user Lenezir displayed a screenshot of his
  desktop and on this was a list of recent Frugalware packages releases. When I
  asked Lenezir how he had done this, I was surprised when he said he used
  <a href="http://conky.sourceforge.net/">Conky</a> to display the RSS feed
  from the Frugalware web site. I didn't know that Conky could display RSS
  feeds but it was a nice surprise.</p>

  <p>For those who want the same feature, below is the line that Lenezir added
  to his Conky configuration file:</p>

  <h3>Look out! There's a monster behind you!</h3>

  <p>I'm sure we have all seen at least one movie in which an innocent person
  is attacked from behind in their own home by a ravenous monster. It's usually
  too late to do anything when they detect the monster's approach. To reduce
  the chance of this happening to you while you're at your PC, you need to use
  your webcam. Simply run an application such as Cheese, which provides a live
  view from your webcam, resize the window and place it in a corner of your
  desktop. You can now easily monitor for ravenous beasts which may try to
  sneak up on you. Of course if one actually attacks, how you escape depends
  entirely on you.</p>

  <p>You might have thought of a simple solution: simply stick a small mirror
  in a corner of your PC's monitor and voila, you can see what's behind you.
  I'm sorry to say that this is not good enough and I'll explain why. In
  movies, a monster will often wait until the person falls asleep and only
  <strong>then</strong> attack. If you're asleep, having a mirror on your PC is
  no help at all because can you can't see what's coming. To solve this problem
  you need to add an application named <a href=
  "http://www.lavrsen.dk/twiki/bin/view/Motion/">Motion</a>, which will record
  images from your webcam at a defined interval and can detect changes between
  images. With this feature, you could set up an alarm when the view behind you
  changes, such as when a monster has appeared! You can tune several parameters
  so that you have enough time to escape, but I'd suggest you have someone else
  test the system first.</p>

  <p>Follow this advice and you're likely to stay safe. Hopefully you'll be
  reading newsletter issue 66! :)</p>

  <p>This section relies on your contributions! If you have some tips and
  tricks that you would like to be shown in the newsletter, <em>please</em>
  post them on the forums.</p>

  "left">Focus On Package(s)</h2>

  <h3>GNOME Media Player</h3>

  <p>There's no award for guessing that the GNOME Media Player (GMP)
  application is a media player, aimed mainly at video playback :) It's
  described in its 'About' dialog box as "A simple media player for GNOME/GTK."
  Of course there are almost as many media players for Linux as there are text
  editors, so your first question may be "Oh no, why another one?" One feature
  which makes it different to other media players is that it supports not just
  one multimedia playback engine, but <strong>three</strong>! The reason for
  this feature is that some media engines are better at playing different
  multimedia formats. Instead of having the user run several players, GMP by
  default automatically selects the "best" engines for the file's format. Its
  features include fullscreen mode, playlist, keyboard controls, toggling of
  visual controls, but it lacks the advanced features of some other media
  players. Try it on your various media files and see if you like
  it.</p><img src=
