  <h2>Frugalware Linux Newsletter - Issue 68</h2>

  <h2>...to inform...to educate...to entertain</h2>

  <p>The difference between a successful person and others is not a lack of
  strength, not a lack of knowledge, but rather a lack in will.&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <em>Vince Lombardi</em></p>

  <h2>Welcome</h2>

  <p>The newsletter's aim is to keep you up to date with what's happened
  recently in the world of the Linux distribution 'Frugalware'.</p>

  <p>Features of this issue include:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>New Frugalware package contributor</li>

    <li>Kernel 2.6.35</li>

    <li>Tips and tricks - What's contained in package X?</li>

    <li>Focus on Package(s) - Googsystray and gst123</li>
  </ul>

  <h2><img src="http://frugalware.org/images/newsletter/event.png" align=
  "left">Events etc</h2>

  <p>Here's a selection of recent events and other items that you might find
  interesting:</p>

  <h3>New Frugalware package contributor</h3>

  <p>Frugalware user Slown recently submitted a FrugalBuild for Talika, a GNOME
  panel applet which allows you to switch between windows via icons. Thanks to
  Slown for his/her contribution because new contributors are always welcome.
  We hope this is just the start and that you choose to package even more
  interesting applications for Frugalware.</p>

  <p>If you find an application that you would like packaged for Frugalware,
  you don't have to do this yourself. Instead you can add a Feature Request in
  the Frugalware <a href="http://bugs.frugalware.org/">Bug Tracking System</a>
  (BTS), giving the name of the application, its home page and a short
  explanation as to why you would like it packaged.</p>

  <h3>Kernel 2.6.35</h3>

  <p>VMiklos recently upgraded the kernel version available in 'current' to
  2.6.35. Frugalware release 1.3 is due soon, so this makes the very latest
  kernel in our latest release, a fantastic combination.</p>

  <h3>Frugalware web site changes</h3>

  <p>Frugalware developers Devil505 and Kooda have been making some changes to
  the homepage, with changes to colours, the logo and minor changes to the
  page's layout. More improvements are likely to be made soon, so be sure you
  look at the home page often. Thanks to Devil505 and Kooda for their work.</p>

  <h3>GUI interface is added to Frugalware</h3>

  <p>I know you may be thinking "We already have a GUI interface for
  Frugalware" but please read on. GUI in this case means "Gamers' User
  Interface", or in this case the joystick. Frugalware developer Devil505
  recently added package rejoystick, which allows you to assign actions to
  joystick movements.</p>

  <p>To properly explain how this works, it's best to use a few examples. To
  select an item from your desktop's menu, you might use the following sequence
  on the joystick.</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Left</li>

    <li>Fire 1</li>

    <li>Up</li>

    <li>Up</li>

    <li>Fire 2</li>

    <li>Fire 2</li>
  </ul>

  <p>This is not limited to your desktop though. Here's an example of how you
  might enter your nickname in your IRC client.</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Left</li>

    <li>Right</li>

    <li>Down</li>

    <li>Up</li>

    <li>Up</li>

    <li>Fire 1</li>

    <li>Down</li>

    <li>Up</li>

    <li>Fire 2</li>

    <li>Fire 1</li>
  </ul>

  <p>I think you'll agree that this is <strong>much</strong> easier and quicker
  than using either the mouse or keyboard. :P Many thanks to Devil505 for
  adding this to Frugalware.</p>

  <h2><img src="http://frugalware.org/images/newsletter/tip.png" align=
  "left">Tips and tricks</h2>

  <p><b>Disclaimer</b> - Be aware that the hints &amp; tips provided here have
  NOT been tested and so come with no warranty.</p>

  <h3>What's contained in package X?</h3>

  <p>Many of the things that we use every day are packaged so that they look
  good on the outside but are actually complex machines underneath. Cars,
  televisions, clocks are all designed to look attractive, but we don't usually
  know what's contained inside. Frugalware's packages exist so that we can
  install and remove them without needing to know what they contain. Sometimes
  though, you might <em>want</em> to know what's inside a particular package.
  Maybe there's a game which contains some graphics you want to use for another
  purpose, but you don't know where it's stored in your PC. To find out the
  contents of a package, simply enter the following command at a command
  prompt:</p>
  <pre>
pacman-g2 -Ql [package_name]
</pre>

  <p>This command gives you a list of every file contained in the package. If
  you are looking for files by name, you can search the command's output by
  piping it into a grep command.</p>

  <p>This section relies on your contributions! If you have some tips and
  tricks that you would like to be shown in the newsletter, <em>please</em>
  post them on the forums.</p>

  "left">Focus On Package(s)</h2>

  <h3>Googsystray</h3>

  <p>Google's services - mail, calendar, RSS feed reader - are just so good
  that many of us use them regularly. If <em>you</em> use them then <a href=
  "http://sourceforge.net/projects/googsystray">Googsystray</a> will almost
  certainly be useful to you. It's a system tray applet which notifies you of
  events which occur in any of the configured Google services and provides
  direct access to some of the basic services. For example, Googsystray can
  provide a count of the number of unread messages in your In box. Below is an
  example screenshot of this in action, where you can see the GMail icon
  overlaid with the number of unread email messages. Of course there are other
  applications which can do this, but this is just an example. Try it out with
  those Google services you use and you probably won't have to load your web
  browser quite as often.</p><img src=

  alt="Screenshot of Googsystray">

  <h3>gst123</h3>

  <p>This is quite interesting because <a href=
  "http://space.twc.de/~stefan/gst123.php">gst123</a> is a command-line media
  player. Although there are many command-line <em>audio</em> players, I
  haven't seen many which can also play video. It was inspired by applications
  such as ogg123 and mpg123 but unlike them it's based on GStreamer, which is
  the reason for "gst" in the name. Being console based, it doesn't have a GUI
  interface but it's still easy to understand, and keyboard controls are used
  to operate the various functions. For playback of multiple files, you can
  list files on the command line, provide a playlist or specify a directory, in
  which case gst123 will search recursively through the directory for files. If
  you don't really need a media player with a GUI interface, try gst123. It's
  so very easy to use and simply "gets the job done".</p>

  <p>Below is a screenshot which gives some idea of its user interface in a
  terminal. Please forgive the poor example audio files but they were all I had
  available at the time. :)</p><img src=
