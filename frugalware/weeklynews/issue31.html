<a name="events"><h2>Events</h2></a>

<p>Here's a selection of events which have occurred since the previous newsletter:</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        <h3>Solaria has arrived</h3>
        <p>As you read this, Frugalware Linux release 0.9 - code name "Solaria" - will have been released. Following in the footsteps of another well-known Linux distribution, a release party has been arranged. It's an all-you-can-eat-and-drink event being held at VMiklos' home. Many thanks to him for hosting this event. :P</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h3>Wallpaper competition - we have a winner!</h3>
        <p>'Z' has won the first ever Frugalware wallpaper competition with entries in the required <a href="http://membres.lycos.fr/zcommezorg/Images/Frug2_4%3A3.png">4:3</a> and <a href="http://membres.lycos.fr/zcommezorg/Images/Frug2_16%3A9.png">16:9</a> ratios. Congratulations to Z and thankyou to all those who entered the competition. Note that they will be hosted permanently on the official Frugalware web site shortly. Please take a look at these entries because they are the default Splashy theme and wallpaper for Frugalware 0.9 - code named "Solaria".</p>
        <p>Another competition is planned for "the big one" - Frugalware 1.0. We encourage everyone to plan ahead for that competition. If you begin work now, you could get feedback from others and be ready with TBEW (The Best Ever Wallpaper).</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h3>Recent changes to the newsletter</h3>
        <p>In issue 30 of the newsletter I made two additions - the title and a quote per newsletter issue. I added the title so that (a) the newsletter's issue number was recorded in the newsletter's text, and (b) the issue would have a title if it was viewed outside the Frugalware web site - e.g. offline. I added an inspirational quote - with a different quote for each newsletter - so that we would be motivated to spend all our time using/developing Frugalware. :P</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h3>OK, so I'm late! :P</h3>
        <p>The unofficial schedule for the newsletter is that it's released every two weeks. I sincerely apologise for the delay with this issue and promise that it won't happen again (until next time :P).</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h3>Errata</h3>
        <p>In a rather embarrassing case of not following my own advice, I've not been checking the validity of the links in the newsletter. Carl Anderson told me shortly after issue 30's release that the links to the Danish newsletter translation were incorrect. He gave me the correct URL and I have corrected the link in this issue.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h3>Frugalware's in the media</h3>
        <p>An article on Frugalware appeared recently in a French-language magazine.  This is great for Frugalware because the more press coverage we get, the more users we're likely to attract. You can find a link to the issue's web page <a href="http://www.ed-diamond.com/produit.php?produit=593">here</a> if you're interested.</p>
    </li>
</ul>

<a name="gettingtoknowyou"><h2>Getting To Know You</h2></a>

    <p>In this section of the newsletter, we get to know Frugalware Linux a little at a time. This is not meant to replace the official documentation but instead present it in a different way. It should also suit those people who, like me, have short attention spans. :)</p>

    <h3>Frugalware's i18n</h3>
    <p>Frugalware is the result of international efforts, with developers and contributors in many countries, including: Hungary, Germany, USA, France, India and Australia. Frugalware's users are also located around the world. One of Frugalware's goals is to be accessible to people in their native language. To achieve this, the official web site, Frugalware's own utilities, the official documentation and this newsletter are available in many languages. Work is underway in translating into further languages, including Polish. The <a href="http://translate.sourceforge.net/wiki/pootle/index?redirect=1">Pootle</a> tool is used in translating everything except the newsletter. Help in providing and maintaining translations is always welcome.</p>


<a name="tips"><h2>Tips and tricks</h2></a>

    <p><b>Disclaimer</b> - Be aware that the hints &amp; tips provided here have NOT been tested and so come with no warranty.</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        <h3>How to determine the date of the installation of a Frugalware system? - submitted by 'VMiklos'</h3>
        <p>There is a file, /var/log/setup.log which is created during the installation, but never modified.  You can use the command </p><pre>ls -l</pre> to see it's modification date. On old systems (before 0.7) we did not create such a file, so there is no easy way to determine that date.  However, in most cases the keymap is never modified after the installation, so if you check the date of the /etc/sysconfig/keymap file, you probably get the correct date.<p></p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h3>Mibbit - web-based IRC service - submitted by 'phayz'</h3>
        <p><a href="http://www.mibbit.com/">Mibbit</a> is a web-based IRC hosting service. Instead of connecting directly to one or more IRC servers from an IRC client, you use a web browser.  Within the browser appears a user interface which is similar to that of most IRC clients. This service is very useful in situations where you have access to a browser but not an IRC client, also where network traffic over IRC's ports is blocked.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h3>Listen and learn - submitted by 'phayz'</h3>
        <p>Linux-related podcasts are a great way of learning about Linux and related topics and can be a great source of entertainment. Be aware though, that those that are really entertaining can have you laughing out loud in public - e.g. on the train/bus or in the office. Many podcasts have very active communities, with active forums, wikis, mailing lists etc.</p>

        <p></p>Here's a list of some of the more popular English-language Linux podcasts:<p></p>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="http://www.linuxoutlaws.com/">Linux Outlaws</a></li>
            <li><a href="http://www.linuxactionshow.com/">The Linux Action Show!</a></li>
            <li><a href="http://linuxbasement.com/">Linux Basement</a></li>
            <li><a href="http://podcast.ubuntu-uk.org/">Ubuntu UK Podcast</a></li>
        </ul>
        <p>Unfortunately two very popular podcasts stopped production this year:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="http://www.lugradio.org/">lugradio</a></li>
            <li><a href="http://linuxreality.com/">Linux Reality</a></li>
        </ul>
        <p>Linux Reality is particularly interesting because each episode is focused on a specific topic, with some topics being covered by several episodes.  Topics include an introduction to Ardour - an advanced audio editor - and a guide on setting up a network.</p>
   </li>
</ul>
    <p>This section relies on your contributions! If have some tips and tricks that you would like to be shown in the newsletter, <em>please</em> post them on the forums. English is my only language so if you want to submit a tip in another language, please do and I'll try to have it translated.</p>


<a name="packages"><h2>Focus On Package(s)</h2></a>

    <h3><a href="">xmllint</a></h3>
        <p>"The xmllint program parses one or more XML files, specified on the command line as xmlfile. It prints various types of output, depending upon the options selected. It is useful for detecting errors both in XML code and in the XML parser itself."</p>
        <p>xmllint is used by the Frugalware project to validate all XML, including some of the web site content. The nature of XML is that it's difficult to validate manually - i.e. by simply looking at it. If you work with XML, it's definitely worthwhile taking the time to use xmllint.</p>

<a name="fixes"><h2>Bug fixes</h2></a>

    <p>The following table gives you a overview of activity on bugs and feature requests as at 9 September 2008. In each cell of the table is a link to a detailed list of the relevant bugs or feature requests.</p>

<a name="security"><h2>Security announcements</h2></a>

    <p><b>Remember</b> - According to the normal support arrangements for Frugalware, the release of 0.8 ("Kalgan") means that support for the previous release has ended. This means that no further security or bug fixes will be released for Frugalware 0.7 ("Sayshell").</p>

    <p>Here is a list of <a href="/security">security issues</a> which have been discovered and fixed in the 0.8 release since the previous newsletter.</p>
