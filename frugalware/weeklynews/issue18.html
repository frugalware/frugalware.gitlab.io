<h2>Events</h2>
<p>
    Here's a selection of events which have occurred since the previous newsletter:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
    <h3>Party time! Kalgan is released.</h3>
        <p>The release of Frugalware 0.8 - code-named "Kalgan" - was announced on 11 March 2008 by vmiklos.  For full details of what this release brings, read his <a href="http://www.frugalware.org/news/91">post</a>.  Just one of the many advances is the new tool 'FUN' - Frugalware Update Notifier.  Now you'll know when you're having fun :)</a></p>
    </li>
    <li>
    <h3>(Another) memory donation - I'm sure about this one :)</h3>
        <p>IroNiQ donated 1 GB RAM which was installed in Genesis - the main server. Many thanks to IroNiQ for his kind donation.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
    <h3>Money, money, money!</h3>
        <p>Distrowatch recently donated US$340 to the Frugalware project with the text "Frugalware Linux is an independent distribution developed by MiklÃ³s Vajna and a small developer community. It was originally inspired by the simplicity of Slackware Linux, but the developers also included Pacman, the excellent package manager from Arch Linux. Pacman, and its graphical front-end, now form an integral part of Frugalware Linux. The project also prides itself on providing the very latest software packages in the repositories, on having a regular 6-month release cycle, and on providing complete security support for the distribution during its lifespan. Frugalware Linux might not be a particularly widely-used distro, but the dedication of the development team is exemplary and they continue to deliver improved releases every few months."  Thank you to Distrowatch!  Of course credit for a great distribution goes to all past and present Frugalware developers and contributors.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
    <h3>VMiklos translates splashy</h3>
        <p>It was noted in the release notes for splashy 0.3.9 that vmiklos provided a Hungarian translation.  This is just one example where Frugalware developers contribute to projects which benefit Frugalware <b>and</b> other Linux distributions.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
    <h3>Happy birthday to Frugalware-fr</h3>
        <p>The <a href="http://frugalware-fr.tuxfamily.org">web site</a> of the French-language Frugalware community recently celebrated its first birthday.  Congratulations to devil505 (its creator) all those who have contributed to its success.  Frugalware aims to be accessible to everyone, regardless of the language they speak.  The French-language Frugalware community helps in that effort.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
    <h3>"Bouleetbil the Builder"</h3>
        <p>Bouleetbil recently approached the development team and offered his help, particularly in maintaining packages.  Since there are many packages whose maintainer has since left the Frugalware project, bouleetbil was asked to look first at these and see which packages he might like to update.  He's already making great progress with the help of the developers, particularly crazy and vmiklos.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
    <h3>It's all Greek to me :)</h3>
        <p>Bill Tux recently approached the development team offering to provide Greek translation of the various Frugalware projects.  As I mentioned above, making Frugalware available to people in their own language is welcome.</p>
    </li>
</ul>


<a name="interview"></a>
    <h2>Frugalware's developers are people too!</h2>
        <p>This is a new feature of the newsletter in which various Frugalware developers reveal a little about themselves.  The aim is to show that "Frugalware's developers are people too!"  I thank the developers for taking the time to answer the questions.  There will be one interview per newsletter (until we run out of developers).</p>

    <h3>hermier</h3>
        <p>This issue's interview is with hermier, whose roles in the Frugalware development team include: documentation, translation administrator and maintenance of the nvidia package.  Please stand and hum the French national anthem while you read his interview.</p>

<dl>
    <dt><b>What's your name?</b></dt>
        <dd>Michel Hermier</dd>
    <dt><b>What's your IRC nickname?</b></dt>
        <dd>hermier</dd>
    <dt><b>In what country do you live?</b></dt>
        <dd>France</dd>
    <dt><b>In what country were you born?</b></dt>
        <dd>France</dd>
    <dt><b>What do you like the most about where you live?</b></dt>
        <dd>It's near the forest, mountains, beach, and most importantly - near my family.</dd>
    <dt><b>What do you do for the Frugalware project?</b></dt>
        <dd>I try to be the (infamous) documentation manager, translation administrator and (nvidia) package maintainer.</dd>
    <dt><b>What motivates you to work on Frugalware?</b></dt>
        <dd>In a few words: reactivity, speed of programs. If you only see read 3 words instead of 4, it's because reactivity counts twice here ;)  Seriously, the team are quick to answer your problems, the number of people involved is quite low, and has a great level of knowledge.  In addition, the fact that we have a low number of patch is a great thing for me.</dd>
    <dt><b>What do you do when you're not working on Frugalware?</b></dt>
        <dd>Chatting with my friends on computers, hacking on KDE, and attempting to have a social life.  I also like to watch movies on TV and in a cinema.</dd>
    <dt><b>What's the view from your front door?</b></dt>
        <dd>Open the door and <a href="http://frugalware.org/images/interviews/hermier.jpg">have a look.</a></dd>

    <h2>Tips and tricks</h2>
    <b>Disclaimer</b> - Be aware that the hints &amp; tips provided here have NOT been tested and so come with no warranty.
<ul>
    <li>
        <h3>Troubleshooting the launch of GUI applications - by 'phayz'</h3>
        <p>You may find that after clicking on the menu item of a GUI application you see the 'busy'cursor, but the application itself doesn't start.  This can happen for several reasons: a library conflict, a missing library etc.  The problem is that you don't see the error messages that occur.  If this happens to you, the best thing to do when diagnosing the problem is to launch the application from a terminal window.  You will then see the error messages that appear and they'll give you a starting point for further troubleshooting.</p>

<a name="packages"</a>
<h2>Focus On Package(s)</h2>

    <h3>AbiWord</h3>
    <p>"<a href="http://www.abisource.com">AbiWord</a> is a free word processing program similar to Microsoft® Word. It is suitable for a wide variety of word processing tasks."   While AbiWord may not have any many features as Microsoft Word or OpenOffice.org Writer, it's advantage is that it's much lighter in terms of resources.  This is great for those PCs - like mine - which are not as powerful as the latest PCs.  Even if you do have a powerful PC, it still makes a great word processor if you're doing mainly basic tasks.  Try it and see for yourself.</p>
