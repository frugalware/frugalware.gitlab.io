  align="left">Events etc</h2>

  <p>Here's a selection of events which have occurred since the
  previous newsletter:</p>

  <h3>Frugalware 1.3 pre1 released</h3>

  <p>On 3 May 2010, VMiklos <a href=
  "http://frugalware.org/news/170">announced</a> the release of the
  first preview of Frugalware 1.3. Perhaps the most exciting part
  of the announcement was that a GUI version of the network
  installer is available for the very first time. Congratulations
  and thanks are due to Elentir, developer of the GUI network
  installer, officially known as Fwife. Elentir has been working on
  Fwife almost since he joined the development team.</p>

  <p>Each preview release has just one aim: to allow people to test
  a snapshot of the next official release. The development team
  needs your help to test the preview on your own hardware and with
  your own combination of packages. The more bugs which are found
  and fixed before the final release, the better quality the
  release will be. If you have the time and bandwidth required,
  please download, install and test this preview.</p>

  <h3>Kooda has been busy</h3>

  <p>Kooda, a new member of the development team, has been busy
  updating FrugalBuilds and creating new ones. Since the previous
  newsletter issue, he has committed 43 new or modified
  FrugalBuilds, many of them being Ruby-related packages. Thanks to
  Kooda and of course we look forward to your next
  contributions.</p>

  <h3>Let Tux be your Commander</h3>

  <p>Frugalware contributor kikadf recently had FrugalBuilds for
  the package TuxCommander and its add-ons accepted by the
  development team. Well done to him and thanks for packaging it.
  Tux Commander is a GUI file management application, with a UI
  design similar to that of Midnight Commander, or Norton
  Commander.</p>

  <h3>Let's make Frugalware 1.3 look great!</h3>

  <p>Each Frugalware release features new default artwork,
  including: GRUB theme, wallpaper, GUI toolkit, login manager,
  mouse pointers and icons. The wallpaper is a central part of the
  theme and all other elements are either based on it or chosen
  because they complement it. To follow the artwork team's
  progress, you can monitor the artwork wiki page for 1.3.</p>

  <p>If instead you want to get involved, you can do so in many
  ways. Comment on the artwork team's creations on the wiki page.
  Of course praise is enjoyed most by the team's members, but
  constructive criticism is also welcome. If you have artwork to
  display or suggest, add to the artwork wiki page. There is also
  an IRC channel available for live chat - #frugalware.artwork -
  but you need to be lucky to find anyone in there.</p>

  <p>Devil505, the artwork team's coordinator, has made it simple
  to have your say in the selection of artwork for the next
  release. On his <a href=
  "http://frugalware.org/~devil505/blog">blog</a> he is conducting
  a number of polls on various artwork elements, seeking peoples'
  opinions on which they would like to be the default for 1.3.
  Right now he's conducting a poll on which icon set should be the
  default. This poll closes on 22 May 2010 so be quick. It's as
  easy as it can be to get involved in Frugalware's artwork so
  please <strong>do</strong> do get involved.</p>

  <h3>Package compression is improved</h3>

  <p>The current method of compression used for Frugalware's
  packages is bzip2, which provides good compression and
  decompression. The development team recently decided that
  packages could be compressed even more with the 'xz' method of
  compression. Smaller packages have two advantages: (1) less*
  storage space is required, and (2) less bandwidth is required
  when they are being downloaded. The extra compression comes at a
  slight cost though, because it takes more CPU time and memory to
  compress a package into the xz format compared to the bzip2
  format. Since packages need to be compressed only once, when they
  are built, this extra load is placed on the build servers, not
  your PC or server.</p>

  <h3>Errata</h3>

  <p>In newsletter issue 62 I included a tip about using
  pacman-g2's regular expression support. The only problem is that
  I don't have much practical experience with regular expressions
  and so made a simple mistake in the example. I know, it seems
  incredible that I could have made such a simple error, but it's
  true. (Note to members of the development team: please don't
  point out to readers all my other past errors! :P). I said that
  the example command would install all packages whose names
  started with the string "gst-plugins-bad" but instead it would
  install all packages which had this string <em>anywhere</em> in
  their name. In this case it wouldn't have made any difference,
  but I still need to correct the example. The correct command
  is:</p>

  <pre>pacman-g2 -S --regex ^gst-plugins-ugly</pre>

  <p>This is the latest in the ongoing series of interviews with
  Frugalware's users. This issue's interview is with Lenezir.
  Please read on...</p>

  <dl>
    <dt><strong>What's your IRC/forum nickname?</strong></dt>

    <dd>
      <p>Lenezir.</p>
    </dd>

    <dt><strong>In what country do you live?</strong></dt>

    <dd>
      <p>France.</p>
    </dd>

    <dt><strong>What operating system(s) did you use before FW
    ?</strong></dt>

    <dd>
      <p>I started with Windows 3.1 when I was very young, then I
      went through Windows 95, 98SE, XP and finally Ubuntu.</p>
    </dd>

    <dt><strong>When did you start to use Linux
    (Frugalware)?</strong></dt>

    <dd>
      <p>I met Linux with Ubuntu in October 2006, then after a year
      of faithful service I wanted to look elsewhere and found
      Frugalware in 2007. I was able to install it only in November
      2008 due to a technical problem.</p>
    </dd>

    <dt><strong>What do you like most about
    Frugalware?</strong></dt>

    <dd>
      <p>The rolling release system which allows to have the latest
      software, the lightness of the distribution, the reactivity
      of the team and especially the atmosphere. It's always a
      pleasure to connect to Jabber and IRC channels because we are
      always welcomed. I really feel like part of a family.</p>
    </dd>

    <dt><strong>What would you like to see changed in
    Frugalware?</strong></dt>

    <dd>
      <p>What is missing most in my opinion is the fact that many
      people fail to install the distribution. Not because of lack
      of experience but problems with hardware recognition. If this
      problem was solved, Frugalware would make a meteoric
      rise.</p>
    </dd>

    <dt><strong>Do you do anything to spread knowledge of
    Frugalware?</strong></dt>

    <dd>
      <p>When I started on Frugalware I started a blog to talk
      about it, but I lost the motivation to write. Maybe I will
      start again. Otherwise I do not have much opportunity to talk
      about it.</p>

      <p>I contribute to the French-language community by
      translating the news items and managing the server that hosts
      the site. I also helped rewrite the web site -
      http://frugalware.fr.</p>
    </dd>

    <dt><strong>For what purpose(s) do you use
    Frugalware?</strong></dt>

    <dd>
      <p>I use Frugalware for my Internet browsing, office
      automation, programming, 3D and for playing games like native
      UrbanTerror or through PlayOnLinux.</p>
    </dd>

    <dt><strong>How did you find Frugalware - e.g. a friend/Google
    search?</strong></dt>

    <dd>
      <p>Doing a search on Google if I remember correctly.</p>
    </dd>

    <dt><strong>Please show us a screenshot of your
    desktop(s)</strong></dt>

    <dt><strong>What's the view from your front door?</strong></dt>

  <h3>What's 1 + 1?</h3>

  <p>Without using a hand-held calculator, calculate the answer
  following equation: ((18263 + 382767 + 27276) / 2) x 1.5</p>

  <p>If you were able to calculate the correct answer in your head
  then you should skip this tip since you obviously don't need it.
  For everyone else, please read on. If you sometimes need to do
  calculations such as this, the command-line application 'bc' is a
  great help. When you start bc, you are then in a console in which
  you type your calculation and press [Enter] and the result
  appears on the next line. bc is capable of much more complex
  calculations but this is just an example. Remember bc when you
  next need to do some calculations, instead of reaching for your
  hand-held calculator.</p>

  <p>This section relies on your contributions! If you have some
  tips and tricks that you would like to be shown in the
  newsletter, <em>please</em> post them on the forums.</p>

  <h3>Textadept</h3>

  <p>Textadept is a cross-platform, general-purpose text editor
  with features including: syntax highlighting, support for
  external tools and complete customisability. What makes it really
  interesting is that while its core was written in C, most of it
  was developed in Lua. Textadept's was designed to be extensible
  and adaptable through scripts written in Lua. Its documentation
  is excellent and always current so anyone writing a script has
  all the help they need. This is a quite young project and still
  under active development, with version 2.2 released recently.
  Take a look at Textadept and I think you'll be pleasantly
  surprised, because there's a lot in a small package.</p>
