 in the world of the Linux distribution 'Frugalware'.</p>

<p>Features of this issue include:
    <ul>
        <li>Frugalware 1.0 is here!</li>
        <li>A Frugalware award!</li>
        <li>Frugalware's users are people too - LGee</li>

    </ul>
</p>


<h2>Events</h2></a>

<p>Here's a selection of events which have occurred since the previous
newsletter:</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        <h3>Frugalware 1.0 is here!</h3>
        <p>On 22 March 2009, Frugalware 1.0 - code name 'Anacreon' - was
        released to the world. VMiklos has said that the number alone doesn't
        mean anything but after 5 years of development, I think Frugalware is
        quite mature. In the past 12 months, there has been a lot of work going
        on that is not visible to Frugalware users. We have new developers, the
        excellent work of the artwork team, new translations, a GUI service
        management tool, excellent progress on a GUI installer and new
        contributors. The future looks very good for Frugalware.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h3>Xfce 4.6 has been released</h3>
        <p>On 27 February 2009, the Xfce development team announced the release
        of Xfce 4.6. Improvements included in this release include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>a new configuration backend;</li>
            <li>a new settings manager;</li>
            <li>a brand new sound mixer;</li>
            <li>several huge improvements to the session manager.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Unfortunately Xfce 4.6 won't be included in Frugalware 1.0 because
        it's still being packaged and tested.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h3>A Frugalware award!</h3>
        <p>Solisius wins the award for most bug reports in one day, with five on
        3 March 2009. Well done!</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h3>Vietnamese translations</h3>
        <p>Clytie Siddall has begun providing Vietnamese translations of
        Frugalware projects, including GFpm, fw-control-center and gservice.
        Since we want Frugalware to be accessible by as many people as possible,
        translations are required to achieve this goal. Thanks to Clytie and all
        other translators.</p>
    </li>
</ul>

<h2>Frugalware's users are people too</h2></a>

<p>This issue's interview is with LGee.</p>

<dl>
    <dt><strong>What's your name?</strong></dt>
        <dd><p>Locsei Gábor. In Hungarian, we use reverse order, the family name
        is the first. My given name is a Hungarian version of Gabriel.</p></dd>

    <dt><strong>What's your IRC/forum nickname?</strong></dt>
        <dd><p>LGee. I used to sign my e-mails with my monogram 'LG', later I
        extended it to 'LGee' when some of my friends began calling me by my
        nick in real life.</p></dd>

    <dt><strong>In what country do you live?</strong></dt>
        <dd><p>In Hungary, Europe. I live in Budapest, the capital of the country.
        </p></dd>

    <dt><strong>In what country were you born?</strong></dt>
        <dd><p>Hungary.</p></dd>

    <dt><strong>What operating system(s) did you use before FW ?</strong></dt>
        <dd><p>I started with Windows 3.11, NT and 98 but I never got too far with
        them, I was only using a browser and MS Office. In 2003, a friend
        introduced me to UHU-Linux, a Hungarian distribution, and my Unix
        adventure began. Later, I became a more demanding user, and I saw that
        UHU's development model is not acceptable for me. In the same time, the
        first releases of Frugalware appeared, and after several other distros
        I decided to give it a try... It was almost 4 years ago,and I'm a happy
        user ever since.
        By the way, I have also used NetBSD/OpenBSD before Frugal, but those are
        just different systems. I don't feel any of them could replace my Linux
        desktops, but I respect their philosophy.</p></dd>

    <dt><strong>When did you start to use Linux (Frugalware)?</strong></dt>
        <dd><p>In 2005, with 0.2 (Aurora).</p></dd>

    <dt><strong>What do you like most about Frugalware?</strong></dt>
        <dd><p>The simple system which will not try to override my preferences,
        the open and friendly behaviour of the developers and the nicely built
        infrastructure around it (documentation, wiki, bug tracker, code
        management etc).</p></dd>

    <dt><strong>What would you like to see changed in Frugalware?</strong></dt>
        <dd><p>The installer... and maybe the marketing. It looks like Frugalware
        is getting out of focus. I don't know what could be done, maybe it's
        just a natural phenomenon.</p></dd>

    <dt><strong>Do you do something active in order to spread the knowledge of
    Frugalware?</strong></dt>
        <dd><p>I try to answer questions and I keep telling people that Frugalware
        is worth trying. I write bits of information in the wiki. When I have
        really much time, I check some bug tracker tickets.</p></dd>

    <dt><strong>For what purpose(s) do you use Frugalware?</strong></dt>
        <dd><p>I use Frugalware on our 2 home laptops for simple functions, on my
        work desktop for everyday work, and I'm just building another file
        server for myself - this will be my first 64bit FW installation.</p></dd>

    <dt><strong>How did you find Frugalware - e.g. a friend/Google search?
    </strong></dt>
        <dd><p>By reading the news on the biggest Hungarian Unix community portal,
         http://hup.hu.</p></dd>

    <dt><strong>What do you do when you're not using Frugalware?</strong></dt>
        <dd><p>I work as a Unix administrator, mostly with AIX which is an
        excellent server operating system - though it's closed source. I love
        sports, especially mountain biking and skiing. I'm preparing for the
        birth of my second child. I take lots of photographs whenever I can.
        </p></dd>

    <dt><strong>Please show us a screenshot of your desktop(s)</strong></dt>
        <dd><p>I use Openbox and Pypanel, so don't expect anything spectacular.
        <a href="http://frugalware.org/images/interviews/lgee_desktop.jpg">Here</a>
         it is.</p></dd>

    <dt><strong>What's the view from your front door? (please provide a
    photograph, with no people in view)</strong></dt>
        <dd><p>I hope to be able to move away from
        <a href="http://frugalware.org/images/interviews/lgee_house.jpg">here</a>.
        </p></dd>

<h2>Getting To Know You</h2>

<p>In this section of the newsletter, we get to know Frugalware Linux a little
 at a time. This is not meant to replace the official documentation but
 instead make it easier to read. This should suit those those people who, like
 me, have short attention spans. :)</p>

<h3>Frugalware is beautiful</h3>
<p>Since it started, Frugalware has had some fantastic artwork, including
startup screens, login screens and wallpapers.  The recently formed Frugalware
artwork team is continuing this great work.</p>
<p>Anyone can be a part of the artwork team but all work has to comply with the
Frugalware artwork rules.  These rules exist to protect everyone's right to
use the artwork and, if they want to, improve it.  You can find the artwork
rules <a href="http://www.frugalware.org/docs/stable/artwork-rules.html">here</a>
.</p>


<h2>Tips and tricks</h2>

<p><b>Disclaimer</b> - Be aware that the hints &amp; tips provided here have NOT
been tested and so come with no warranty.</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        <h3>Linux Quick Fix Notebook</h3>
        <p>The "Linux Quick Fix Notebook" is a fantastic guide for anyone who is
        interested in Linux system administration. It's available for free in
        PDF format, as are all of the
        <a href="http://www.informit.com/promotions/promotion.aspx?promo=135563">
        "Bruce Perens Open Series"</a>. It's written in quite simple language,
        with each part explained clearly. All the instructions are written for
        Red Hat Linux but they're easy to adapt to suit Frugalware. As explained
        at the book's web site, "Peter Harrison addresses virtually every aspect
        of Linux administration, from software installation to security, user
        management to Internet services - even advanced topics such as software
        RAID and centralized LDAP authentication."</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h3>S5 Presentation Application</h3>
        <p>If you need to do a presentation, consider using the S5 presentation
        application. As described on its web site:
        "<a href="http://meyerweb.com/eric/tools/s5/">S5</a> is a slide show
        format based entirely on XHTML, CSS, and JavaScript. With one file, you
        can run a complete slide show and have a printer-friendly version as
        well. The markup used for the slides is very simple, highly semantic,
        and completely accessible. Anyone with even a smidgen of familiarity
        with HTML or XHTML can look at the markup and figure out how to adapt it
        to their particular needs. Anyone familiar with CSS can create their own
        slide show theme. It's totally simple, and it's totally
        standards-driven."</p>
    </li>
</ul>

<p>This section relies on your contributions! If you have some tips and tricks that
 you would like to be shown in the newsletter, <em>please</em> post them on the
  forums.</p>


<h2>Focus On Package(s)</h2>

<h3>Gigolo</h3>
<p><a href="http://www.uvena.de/gigolo/">Gigolo</a> "is a frontend to easily
manage connections to remote filesystems using GIO/GVfs. It allows you to
quickly connect/mount a remote filesystem and manage bookmarks of such." Gigolo
is distributed as officially part of the Xfce Goodies project but Xfce is not a
dependency. "Gigolo" seems a strange name for such an application, but as
explained by its author, "...actually it fits pretty well for what it does:
It mounts what it is told to. That's all." If you don't know the meaning of the
word, I'd suggest you check a dictionary.</p>

<h3>medit</h3>
<p><a href="http://medit.sourceforge.net">medit</a> is a text editor written
using the GTK+ toolkit.  Its behaviour and appearance are very similar to gedit,
the default Gnome text editor.  To enhance its features, medit offers plugins
and user-defined tools.  Plugins are written in C and medit comes with three -
a file browser pane, a file list pane, and a function browser.  User-defined
tools appear in the "Tools" menu and can be written in a scripting language,
Lua or Python.  For those who use both Windows and Linux, medit works in both
operating systems.  Its main dependency is the GTK+ toolkit so it's not
dependent on any desktop environment.  If your text editing requirements are
fairly simple, try medit.</p>



<h2>Bug fixes</h2></a>
