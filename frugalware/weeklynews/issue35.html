<a name="events"><h2>Events</h2></a>

<p>Here's a selection of events which have occurred since the previous newsletter:</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        <h3>Frugalware is featured on the Linux Void podcast</h3>
        <p>I recently wrote to the <a href="http://www.linuxvoid.com/">Linux Void</a> podcast, asking that they review Frugalware Linux.  They read my email on episode 12 and the very next episode featured the review.  Overall the review was very positive, with the reviewer impressed with the fact that it's fast and easy to use.</p>
        <p>Highlights of the review included:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>"When you boot...you're really surprised...it's not the sort of distro you see every day...it's not Ubuntu"</li>
            <li>"It's really fast and the package manager is really fast"</li>
            <li>"The installer was very easy to use"</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h3>Boobaa The Wise :P</h3>
        <p>Many Frugalware users will know that Boobaa is a package maintainer (including many Java-related packages), also resident expert on Drupal (a FLOSS content management system).  What you may <em>not</em> know is that he's also an expert on how hardware works - particularly CPUs.  As proof, let me quote from IRC dated 23 September 2008 -</p>
        <p><code>&lt boobaa &gt	DeX77: staring at "javac: Assembling..." for ages states that a HUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUGE pile of java crap is being fed into your CPU. but beware: CPUs work with smoke. if the smoke comes out, they will not work any more</code></p>
        <p>If you have <em>any</em> hardware problem, please send an email to boobaa [AT] i_can_fix_your_hardware_with_a_hammer.com.hu.  He'll be happy to help. :)</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h3>Publicity for Frugalware</h3>
        <p>Plan√®te LINUX, a French PC magazine, recently published an article about Frugalware.  The magazine is not available online but if you live in France, buy issue 54.  It's great when Frugalware gets publicity because people may then try it and, of course, begin using it.  Frugalware can get better with more users because it means more people using (and testing) packages, and it's likely to bring new developers.</p>
        <p>Links to other articles and reviews of Frugalware are linked in the web site's menu at About > Frugalware in the Press.  If you discover news about Frugalware that's not already in the list, please tell us and we'll add a link.  The easiest method of contact is adding an item to the Frugalware forum.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h3>HEY!  Look at me!</h3>
        <p>Devil505 recently established a new web site devoted to eye candy for Frugalware - <a href="http://www.frugalware-art.org">www.frugalware-art.org</a>.  One section which needs more entries is the screenshots section.  <em>Please</em> submit a screenshot of your desktop.  Someone else might appreciate your desktop and want to know how to create a similar desktop.  Let the world see what you see every time you're at your PC.  There are just two things to note: (1) you might like to include a screenshot with <em>and</em> without applications running, (2) please make sure the screenshot is safe for work/home.  </p>
    </li>
</ul>


<a name="interview"><h2>Frugalware's contributors are people too! - Carl Anderson</h2></a>

<p>Here is the latest interview, with Frugalware contributor Carl Anderson, proving that you're only as old as the Linux distribution you use.  He wins the prize for the longest ever interview/profile.  I don't know how to tell him that he's not being paid by the word. :P</p>

<dl>
    <dt><strong>What's your name?</strong></dt>
        <dd><p>Carl Andersen.  I was born in 1954, so I am not that young any more. :)</p></dd>

    <dt><strong>What's your IRC nickname?</strong></dt>
        <dd><p>bee-carl.  I must admit, I am not often in the IRC channel. You have to write rather quickly in IRC, and I must have time to write proper English, otherwise it ends up as one big mess that nobody understands.  English is after all not my native language. :)</p></dd>

    <dt><strong>In what country do you live?</strong></dt>
        <dd><p>Denmark</p></dd>

    <dt><strong>In what country were you born?</strong></dt>
        <dd><p>Denmark</p></dd>

    <dt><strong>What do you like most about where you live (the town/city and country)?</strong></dt>
        <dd><p>The village I live in, is called  <a href="http://maps.google.dk/maps?f=s&utm_campaign=dk&utm_source=dk-ha-emea-dk-google-gm&utm_medium=ha&utm_term=Vemmelev">Vemmelev</a>.  It's a village with 3500 inhabitants.  We have settled there because it is near the sea. Both my wife and I love the sea, and when I was young I used to do lot of yacht racing in different yachting clubs.  What I like about this country, is all the water it's surrounded by, you need not drive far to reach the sea.</p></dd>

    <dt><strong>When did you start to use Linux?</strong></dt>
        <dd><p>I started using Linux in February 1999.  In a computer magazine there was a CD with RedHat 5.2 and I installed it beside Windows 95 on my old Pentium 90Mhz computer. From January 2000 I have only used Linux.  Well, what else have I tried? SuSe, Mandrake, Debian, Libranet, Slackware, Archlinux, VectorLinux but I wasn't quite satisfied with any of them.</p></dd>

    <dt><strong>How did you find Frugalware - e.g. a friend/Google search?</strong></dt>
        <dd><p>It was by pure coincidence that I read a <a href="http://polishlinux.org/linux/frugalware/review-frugalware-0-5-siwenna/">review of Frugalware 0.5 (Siwenna)</a>.  In October 2006, I installed it on one of my old machines, and BINGO! here was the distribution I so long had been looking for.</p></dd>

    <dt><strong>What do you like most about Frugalware?</strong></dt>
        <dd><p>The short answer: simplicity, stability.  The community is also very positive and friendly, you can always get help by using the forums or mailing lists.</p></dd>

    <dt><strong>What would you like to see changed in Frugalware?</strong></dt>
        <dd><p>It would be nice if there was the possibility of having more of Frugalware translated in the future. It means a lot to some people that as much has been translated into their own language for example, sysvinit, etc.</p></dd>

    <dt><strong>For what purpose(s) do you use Frugalware?</strong></dt>
        <dd><p>The short answer: I use it for everything.  Just recently I have started taking an interest in programming, and for this purpose Frugalware is ideal as it tends to have a big selection of packages.  It may seem late for someone of my age to start programming, but you are never too old to learn something new. :)  It is a <a href="http://beehivecards.com/">program</a> meant to be useful in selecting queens in beekeeping.  Who knows, one day it may become a Frugalware package. :)</p></dd>

    <dt><strong>Do you do something active in order to spread the knowledge of Frugalware?</strong></dt>
        <dd><p>Of course, :) I have the Danish homepage <a href="http://frugalware.dk/">http://frugalware.dk/</a> where I have the Danish translations of the newsletters, news, Howto's, etc.  I am also a Danish translator of Frugalware programs, Pacman-G2, setups, frugalwareutil's, etc.  I am also soon to finish the translation of the Documentation for Frugalware. It's a large mouthful. :)  I also advertise all news concerning Frugalware on the largest <a href="http://www.linuxin.dk/">Danish community</a> for Linux users in Denmark.</p></dd>

    <dt><strong>What do you do when you're not using Frugalware?</strong></dt>
        <dd><p>Whatever I want to do. :) Joke aside, I retired early in 1991. I had managed to destroy my back by working as a Thermit Welder in the Danish Railways.  Other than that I help my wife with our beekeeping.  We work with the Italian bee <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apis_mellifera_ligustica">Apis mellifera ligustica</a>.  We have had 120 bee families for a couple of years and have produced between 1000-1200 queens for sale, but the last 2 years the price of honey has fallen drastically, so now we only get about the same price as 20 years ago.  So we have been forced to cut down to only having 30 bee families and we only produce 150 queens for sales.  Now that you know I am a bee-keeper you have to see a picture of some of our beehives, so <a href="http://frugalware.org/images/interviews/carl_beehives.jpg">here</a> it is.</p>

        <p>I am the chairman of <a href="http://ligustica.dk/">The Danish Association Of Ligustica Breeders.</a>  It's a society which is involved in working with Apis mellifera ligustica. I am also cashier in <a href="http://www.dronningavlerne.dk/">The Danish Queen Association of 1921</a>.  I also maintain their homepage.</p>

        <p>I have been a member of <a href="http://en.sslug.dk/">SSLUG</a> for 5 years, the largest Danish LUG.  In 2003 we were 15 people who created a local department of SSLUG, which we named the sandbox.  We hold meetings at <a href="http://www.ruc.dk/RUC_en/">Roskilde University</a>.
There is a meeting every Monday, but I only have time to go to the meetings from September to April, I am there 2 times a month during the winter season. At these meetings experienced users of Linux exchange experiences, but the beginner will also be able to get the help they need at these meetings.</p>

        <p>I also maintain the Danish translation of <a href="http://www.stuff.yellowswordfish.com/">Simple:Press Forum</a> . It's a forum made as a plugin for WordPress.</p>

        <p>Even though I retired early (at the age of 37), I have no problem finding things to do :)</p></dd>

    <dt><strong>What's the view from your front door?</strong></dt>
        <dd><p>The picture is taken from the garden behind the house. Anyway, why not open the door and  <a href="http://frugalware.org/images/interviews/carl_house.jpg">take a look.</a></p></dd>

<a name="gettingtoknowyou"><h2>Getting To Know You</h2></a>

    <p>In this section of the newsletter, we get to know Frugalware Linux a little at a time.  This is not meant to replace the official documentation but instead make it easier to read.  This should suit those those people who, like me, have short attention spans.  :)</p>

    <h3>Searching for packages with pacman-g2</h3>
    <p>A Frugalware user with the nick 'nicalvaro' was recently searching for a package matching the description "image viewer".  He/she was confused by the fact that some packages appeared in the output more than once.  Voroskoi and VMiklos came to the rescue, explaining that pacman-g2 was actually searching for the words "image" and "viewer" separately. Any package which had <em>both</em> words in its name or description would appear twice in the search results.  Voroskoi's suggestion was that in this case the command "pacman-g2 -Ss image.*viewer" would have found all packages with the phrase "image viewer" in their description.</p>

    <h3>Unwanted packages</h3>
    <p>Often when you install a package, other packages are also installed because the original package is dependent upon them.  If you then remove the package, the dependent packages are left installed, because pacman-g2 can't know if you're using them or not.  pacman-g2 has the "-Qe" option to search for and list those packages which were installed as dependencies but are no longer required.  Once you have their names you can then decide if you want to remove them or leave them installed.  pacman-g2 is able to perform such "magic" because it records for each package whether it was explicitly installed or installed as a dependency.</p>

<a name="tips"><h2>Tips and tricks</h2></a>

    <b>Disclaimer</b> - Be aware that the hints &amp; tips provided here have NOT been tested and so come with no warranty.
<ul>
    <li>
        <h3>Setting the default editor - submitted by Carl Anderson</h3>
        <p>There are many editors to Frugalware e.g Vi, Nano, Joe, Emacs. It is  possible to select a  default editor for the system, which will always be used when you open a configuration file, added a cronjob, etc. This will be the editor that all users will be using as the default editor.</p>
        <p>Here is an example where Nano will be used. Open the file /etc/profiles as root and, under these three lines:</p>
        <p><pre>
        # Default umask. A umask of 022 prevents new files from being created group
        # and world writable.
        umask 022
        </pre></p>
        <p>Add the following:</p>
        <p><pre>EDITOR=/usr/bin/nano
        export EDITOR
        </pre></p>
        <p>If you want to use Nano as the editor in MC (Midnight Commander) then Choose F9> Options> Configuration> in MC, remove mark for use internal editor> then save.  Do this to MC when logged in to your normal account, also as root, then the editor in MC will also be Nano when you're  editing files as root.</p>
    </li>

        <h3>Redecorate your home with cheat sheets - submitted by phayz</h3>
        <p>Cheat sheets are one-page documents, usually in tabular format, used for quick reference.  They're particularly useful for computer topics where you are often using a fairly small set of commands.  You may find the following sites' cheat sheets useful:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="http://www.addedbytes.com/cheat-sheets/">www.addedbytes.com/cheat-sheets/</a> - regular expressions, MySQL, PHP</li>
            <li><a href="http://zrusin.blogspot.com/2007/09/git-cheat-sheet.html">Git cheat sheet</a></li>
            <li><a href="http://jan-krueger.net/development/git-cheat-sheet-extended-edition">(Another) Git cheat sheet</a></li>
        </ul>
        <p>Even if you don't refer to them, another great use for cheat sheets is in covering ugly spots on your walls.  Your room will look better and it will add to your geek credentials.  What a bonus! :)</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h3>Firefox Add-on - LinkChecker - submitted by phayz</h3>
        <p>In newsletter issue 30 I suggested the package Linkchecker for checking hyperlinks in documents you were publishing on the Internet.  This package has many options and can be too complex if you <em>only</em> want to check hyperlinks.  Following on from the previous newsletter issue, another Firefox add-on can be used instead.  <a href="http://www.kevinfreitas.net/extensions/linkchecker/">LinkChecker</a> checks the status of hyperlinks in the web page you're currently viewing.  As it checks each link it changes the background colour of the link's text according the result.  If the link is accessible, the background colour is changed to light green, if it's not accessible it's changed to light red, and if access was denied it's changed to light gray.  There are some limitations to LinkChecker, including the fact that you can check only one document (the current one) at a time, but it's definitely worth using.</p>
    </li>
</ul>
    <p>This section relies on your contributions! If have some tips and tricks that you would like to be shown in the newsletter, <em>please</em> post them on the forums.</p>


<a name="packages"><h2>Focus On Package(s)</h2></a>

    <h3>Tidy</h3>
        <p>Any professional web developer who looks at the source of the Frugalware newsletters will probably fall off their chair laughing.  I'm definitely <em>not</em> expert in (X)HTML and the formatting of the newsletters shows that.  <a href="http://tidy.sourceforge.net/">Tidy</a> is a utility which can check (X)HTML for formatting errors and/or reformat it so that it's consistent.  It's often used as an external utility in text editors, to tidy up source code.  There's even a <a href="http://www.eng.tau.ac.il/~atavory/gedit-plugins/html-tidy/">native version for gedit</a>, the default Gnome text editor.</p>
        <p>For anyone who's interested, I have <em>not</em> yet taken my own advice and used Tidy on the HTML source of the Frugalware newsletter.</p>

    <h3>Devede</h3>
        <p>Creating a video DVD from a collection of video files can be difficult if you do it at the command line.  <a href="http://www.rastersoft.com/programas/devede.html">Devede</a> is a GUI utility whose aim is to be make this task easier.  To create a video DVD, you choose the video files you want on the DVD and Devede will create an ISO, ready to be burned to media.  Some cool options include selecting a custom background for the DVD menu and music to be played while the menu is showing.  The results are very good so why not try Devede?</p>
        <p>With Christmas coming soon you could record your Christmas party, make a video DVD and give everyone a copy as a Christmas gift.  Next Christmas you'll be alone so you'll have lots of time for Frugalware.  :P</p>
