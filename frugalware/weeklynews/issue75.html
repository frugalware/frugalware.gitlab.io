  <p>Here is a selection of recent events and other items that you might find
  interesting:</p>

  <h3>Frugalware 1.4 Release Candidate 2 released</h3>

  <p>On 28 January 2011, VMiklos <a href="http://frugalware.org/news/193">
  announced</a> the availability of Frugalware 1.4 Release Candidate 2. This
  allows Frugalware developers and users alike to download and test what will
  become 1.4, code-name "Nexon". As always, if you have the available time and
  bandwidth, <em>please</em> test this release and report any bugs you find.
  There will be one more release candidate before the final release of 1.4, so
  please help make 1.4 the best ever version.</p>

  <h3>Frugalware tweak! and Frugalware tweak 2! ???</h3>

  <p>If you read the frugalware-current commit log, or Bouleetbil's
  <a href="http://dors.frugalware.org/blogengine/post/mono-bump-frugalware-tweak-vs-frugalware-tweak2.aspx">blog</a>, you
  might have noticed that there is now a Frugalware tweak! <em>and</em>
  Frugalware tweak! 2. Please don't be alarmed, you're not going crazy. There
  really are two editions of Frugalware tweak!</p>

  <p>FT2 is not a version upgrade of FT1 but instead the same application
  developed using a different language. Frugalware tweak! was first developed
  using Mono and, to please those who don't like to use Mono-based applications,
  Bouleetbil is re-developing it in Vala. The second "edition" is available in
  the 'current' repository but is in very early stages of its development. The
  first priority is to develop FT2 so it has the same functionality as FT1.
  Both editions will be maintained for at least the near future. If you haven't
  tried Frugalware tweak! you now have twice any many reasons to do so. :P</p>

  <h3>systemd init system will be available in Frugalware Linux 1.4</h3>

  <p>The Frugalware developers have successfully integrated the systemd init
  system. It will be available as an alternative to the current init system -
  sysvinit. Note that it will <em>not</em> be the default init system but will
  require 'activation' by the user.</p>

  <p>systemd offers technical advantages over sysvinit but that's not the only
  reason it was chosen instead of other init systems. It's an unofficial
  Frugalware policy to work as <em>part of</em> the FLOSS community, for
  everyone's benefit. systemd was created by Lennart Poettering, the creator
  of PulseAudio, but people from other Linux distributions including OpenSUSE
  and Fedora are also part of its development. We benefit by sharing the
  maintenance and troubleshooting workload, also the experiences of everyone in
  the systemd user community.</p>

  <h3>KDE 4.5.5 is available</h3>

  <p>The very latest version of KDE - 4.5.5 - is available in the 'current'
  package repository, thanks to Devil505. It features "translation updates,
  performance and stability improvements and other bugfixes", according to the
  KDE home page. This version was released on 7 January 2011 and it was
  available in Frugalware on 13 January 2011, just 6 days later! KDE lovers, get
  pacman-g2 sync-ing and enjoy all it has to offer.</p>

  <h3>Do-dec-a-he-what!?</h3>

  <p>A member of the Ubuntu community recently <a href=
  "http://www.clapico.com/2011/01/08/calendrier/">designed</a> a <a href=
  "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dodecahedron">dodecahedron</a> which
  features a calendar for 2011, with each face featuring the dates of a
  month. Inspired by this, Frugalware artwork team member Centuri0 produced
  a <a href="http://frugalware-art.org/content/show.php?content=137291">
  Frugalware version</a> of this calendar. I think the end result looks
  great! To create the calendar you print the design on a suitable piece of
  paper, then cut and fold as necessary to produce the final product. Go
  ahead and make it yourself, so that you have a constant reminder of your
  favourite Linux distribution. If you want to save money you could even
  give them to friends and family as gifts. The good part is that even if
  they throw them back at you, they won't hurt. :P</p>

  <h3>Blogs, blogs, blogs</h3>

  <p>The Frugalware <a href="http://planet.frugalware.org/">Planet</a> web site
  presents a selection of articles from the blogs of various Frugalware
  developers and contributors. Only the content that the bloggers think relates
  directly to Frugalware appears on the Planet site. There's much more to their
  blogs, though, so why not browse and see what else they have to say? It's
  definitely worth the effort.</p>

  <div class="postheader">Frugalware's users are people too!</div>
  <img class="face" src="/images/newsletter/users.png" width="85" height="85" alt="" /><br />

  <p>This is the latest in the ongoing series of interviews with Frugalware's
  users. Even though we have at least one thing in common - our use of
  Frugalware - everyone has a different, interesting story to tell.</p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <p><em>What's your name?</em></p>

      <p>François BIOT</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p><em>What’s your IRC/forum nickname?</em></p>

      <p>hsaturn, since 20+ years. Not for the planet, but for the Saturn, a
      very cool processor that equiped the hd28s and hp48sx calculators...</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p><em>In what country do you live?</em></p>

      <p>France in Bezons, approximately 5km west of Paris.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p><em>What operating system(s) did you use before FW ?</em></p>

      <p>Many Linux distributions. Mainly Mandake, which is Mandriva today. I
      tried many and many different ones, except Debian. Don't ask me why there
      is absolutely no reason for that. My companies also were chosen because
      of their Linux activities.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p><em>When did you start to use Linux (Frugalware)?</em></p>

      <p>Linux : since about 24 years ! 486 DX2 4mbps RAM... X11 was sloooow.
      Frugalware since version 0.5.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p><em>What do you like most about Frugalware?</em></p>

      <p>The team for sure! And this is a distribution where we can contribute
      very easily, no need to become a ranked user, a VIP, a gold winner etc.
      Frugalware is the only distribution that has a package contributed by me.
      !</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p><em>What would you like to see changed in Frugalware?</em></p>

      <p>I would like to see a pacman-g2 that knows how to download more than
      one package at once, and from more than one FTP site.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p><em>Do you do anything to spread knowledge of Frugalware?</em></p>

      <p>Each time I speak about Linux, in real life or in the web, and of
      course at work.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p><em>For what purpose(s) do you use Frugalware?</em></p>

      <p>Well, I'm using it at work, for my team, and have installed two
      development servers for the company. About 10 developers are using them
      every day. Also we have about 20 touch screens installed in our shops that
      are running under a highly customized version of Frugalware. At home I've
      convinced my family to use Linux, and now, they don't want to hear about
      Windows :-). Today, all our PCs except one are under Frugalware
      current.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p><em>How did you find Frugalware - e.g. a friend/Google
      search?</em></p>

      <p>Google for sure, when searching for the most up to date distro.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p><em>What do you do when you're not using Frugalware?</em></p>

      <p>I try to play/learn music (guitar and synth) when my 3-year-old to
      little boy doesn't need me. And he needs me all the time, so ... :-)</p>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <div class="postheader">Tips and Tricks</div>

  <p><strong>Disclaimer</strong> - Be aware that the hints &amp; tips provided
  here have NOT been tested and so come with no warranty.</p>

  <h3>Find your fastest mirror</h3>

  <p>This tip has appeared in the newsletter in the past but I thought it was
  worth repeating. When downloading packages, pacman-g2 requests the file from
  each of the mirrors listed in /etc/pacman-g2/repos/frugalware(-current),
  working through the list in order until successful or the file couldn't be
  found on any mirror. If the mirror(s) from which your packages are being
  downloaded is on the other side of the world, you're not likely to get the
  best download rate. To test this, use a tool such a wget to download a file
  from each of the mirrors that are closest to you and compare the download
  rates. If you find one which is faster than all the others, move it in the
  list of mirrors so that it is at the top.</p>

  <p>This section relies on your contributions! If you have some tips and
  tricks that you would like to be shown in the newsletter, <em>please</em>
  post them on the forums.</p>

  <br />
  <div class="postheader">Focus on Package(s)</div>
  <img class="face" src="/images/newsletter/package-new.png" width="85" height="85" alt="" /><br />


  <p>When Frugalware developer ryuo asked me to review the following
  packages, I first thought of asking him for payment. He has recently
  added these to the 'current' repository so this seemed like free
  advertising. Now that I have had a chance to look at them I agree that
  they're very useful. I have decided, then, to include them without any
  fee being paid. Next time, though, the price will be double! :P</p>

  <p>Both of the following applications were developed using the Qt framework,
  the basis of the KDE Software Collection. Even if you don't use KDE, you
  should take a look at these two because they depend only on Qt, not KDE
  itself. They would fit in just about anywhere and provide some very useful
  functionality.</p>

  <h3>Juffed</h3>

  <p>Juffed is an advanced text editor and in addition to the standard
  features of any text editor, it offers:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>syntax highlighting;</li>
    <li>find in files;</li>
    <li>autocompletion;</li>
    <li>code folding.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>It offers two useful features which help editing on commonly-used files:
  favourites and sessions. The favourites feature allows you to maintain a
  list of files which you use commonly. This might include files containing
  snippets of code or your projects To Do list, for example. The sessions
  feature is common to other editors and allows you to easily work on a group
  of files at a time. You can save a session with a meaningful name and switch
  between sessions as you need.</p>

  <a href="http://frugalware.org/images/newsletter/issue75_screenshot_juffed.png"><img src="http://frugalware.org/images/newsletter/issue75_screenshot_juffed_t.png" alt="Screenshot of Juffed text editor"></a>

  <h3>Qedit</h3>

  <p>Like Juffed, qedit is an advanced text editor developed using the Qt
  framework. It has a slightly different set of features than Juffed,
  including:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>syntax highlighting;</li>
    <li>spell checking;</li>
    <li>code folding.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Qedit offers a feature named "multiple views". It allows you to split the
  current window into multiple panes, containing another portion of the same
  file or a different file. This can be very useful when you're working on
  related pieces of code in the same file, or particularly when they are in
  separate files.</p>

  <p>To provide some customisation of Qedit's behaviour when editing files of
  different types, it offers a featurre named "Document classes". Each document
  class is a group of settings applied to all files where either the name or
  first line matches a regular expression. The settings can be easily modified
  via a GUI interface and include the following:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>syntax highlighting patterns;</li>
    <li>indentation rules;</li>
    <li>text edition macros;</li>
    <li>matching parenthesis highlighting;</li>
    <li>logical blocks markers.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Try Qedit if you're looking for an advanced text editor which is fast,
  friendly and allows you to see different parts of the same file in one
  view.</p>
