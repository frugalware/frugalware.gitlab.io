<h2>Events</h2>
<p>
	Here's a selection of events which have occurred since the previous newsletter:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>
	<h3>Dex77 helps out with Splashy</h3>
		<p>The following message was noted in the Splashy changelog for 0.3.6 - "uses the real size of the screen and not that reported by the surface. (Thanks to DeX77 from #frugalware for helping to get this fixed)".</p>
		<p>Well done Dex77!</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<h3>FUN is now Danish</h3>
		<p>Carl Anderson recently translated the FUN (Frugalware Update Notifier) into Danish.  Thanks to Carl for his contribution and all others who are also translating Frugalware text.</p>
		<p>Now, what's Danish for "fun"?</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<h3>Frugalware to be the #1 games platform!  :)</h3>
		<p>As at last count, Frugalware has 63 games and related packages in the -current repository.  Big names include Tremulous, Chromium, Nexuiz and Extreme Tuxracer.</p>
		<p>Move over Playstation 3, XBox 360 - here comes Frugalware!</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<h3>Black(listing) is the new Black</h3>
		<p>Blacklisting support has been improved.  Users often requested to be able to blacklist for example the ipv6 module, but it was not possible until now, with udev&gt;=118-1.  Just list it in the usual `/etc/sysconfig/blacklist` file! As a side effect, autodetecting hardware is now done before everything else - silently. So don't be surprised that the `hotplug` service disappeared from the middle of the boot process.</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<a name="tips"></a>
<h2>Tips and tricks</h2>
<ul>
	<li>
		<h3>Reverse SSH tunnel - submitted by 'vmiklos'</h3>
	<p>If you have a client behind a firewall and you have a server somewhere. and you want to ssh from the server to the client, you can use ssh's magic -R option!<p>
	<p>if you do an<p>
	<p><pre>$ ssh -R 14443:localhost:22 server</pre></p>
	<p>You can ssh to client:22 from the server by ssh-ing to localhost:14443 on the server.  It works even if the client is behind a firewall!</p>
	</li>
