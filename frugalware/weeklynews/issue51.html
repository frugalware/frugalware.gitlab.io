  <h2>Events etc.</h2>

  <p>Here's a selection of events which have occurred since the previous
  newsletter:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <h3>Frugalware 1.1 (Getorin) was released</h3>

      <p>On 7 September 2009, VMiklos announced the release of Frugalware 1.1 -
      code-named 'Getorin'. This is the most exciting event that's happened
      recently, with Getorin being the 11th release. Congratulations to the
      whole of the developer team, because it includes some exciting changes,
      including:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Up to date packages: Linux kernel 2.6.30.5, GNU C library 2.10.1,
        Xorg 7.4 with xorg-server 1.6, GNOME 2.26.3, XFCE 4.6.1, GCC 4.4.0 to
        name a few major components;</li>

        <li>New artwork, including a new wallpaper and various themes based on
        it;</li>

        <li>An x86_64 flash plugin as part of the default installation.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li>
      <h3>Frugalware 1.1's release party</h3>

      <p>The party to celebrate Frugalware 1.1's release was a great success.
      Everyone enjoyed themselves, talking about the past 5 years of Frugalware
      and what the next 5 years might bring. VMiklos is still hoping that the
      next 5 years bring him a Mercedes Benz 'Kompressor'. Talking of cars,
      there was good and bad news about the party's food. First, the good news
      - Cedynamix works at a car workshop, and so was able to get sponsorship
      of the food by Michelin, the tyre manufacturer. Now the bad news - the
      food was actually made of re-processed rubber so although it looked OK,
      it tasted like old car tyres. :( Next time we'll think twice before
      accepting sponsorship. Aside from the food, we hope the next release
      party is as much fun.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <h3>A new contributor</h3>

      <p>Pingax - a new Frugalware contributor - recently submitted a
      FrugalBuild for mp3blaster, a command-line MP3 player. The FrugalBuild
      was reviewed and accepted by Devil505. Thanks to Pingax for the
      contribution and we hope this is the start of a long packaging
      career.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <h3>"Best of Hints and Tips"</h3>

      <p>I'll soon be featuring a selection of the best hints and tips that
      have appeared in the newsletter. Of course the first task is to select
      the best from all past newsletter issues. I asked my mother and she said
      "Oh but they're each as good as each other", which didn't help at all.
      I'll just have to do the hard work myself. :(</p>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Getting To Know You</h2>

  <p>In this section of the newsletter, we get to know Frugalware Linux a
  little at a time. This is not meant to replace the official documentation but
  instead make it easier to read. This should suit those those people who, like
  me, have short attention spans. :)</p>

  <h3>Vanilla packages</h3>

  <p>Frugalware's packages are as close as possible to the source code provided
  by the project. Frugalware-specific patches are only applied when necessary -
  e.g. to fix a security bug for which an official release hasn't been made.
  There are several good reasons for using "vanilla" (unpatched) source code,
  including:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>patches are the distribution's responsibility and we don't need any
    extra burden;</li>

    <li>patches may introduce bugs or security issues;</li>

    <li>support is available directly from the project.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>New Packages</h2>

  <p>In this new section of the newsletter I'll highlight some new packages
  which have been added since the previous issue.</p>

  <h2>Tips and tricks</h2>

  <p><b>Disclaimer</b> - Be aware that the hints &amp; tips provided here have
  NOT been tested and so come with no warranty.</p>

  <h3>RTFM</h3>

  <p>Anyone who has asked a technical question has probably been given the
  following answer at some time: RTFM, which is an abbreviation for Read The
  Fine Manual. Sometimes the word "Fine" is replaced with another word which
  also starts with the letter 'F' but I can't remember which word. :P Even
  experienced Linux users should take this advice and read the documentation
  which was provided with the applications that they use. Of course you might
  think that you can already do all that you need. However the documentation
  might describe a more efficient method, possibly tell you about great
  features that are not obvious. When you first install a package, please take
  the time to read its documentation, even if it's only a README. You just
  might learn something new!</p>

  <h3>Transparency versus performance</h3>

  <p>Several window managers offer real transparency, in which the contents of
  any windows below another window are visible, usually with some opaqueness.
  To provide this feature requires a lot of computation by the CPU and/or
  graphics card. Providing this feature while windows are moved around the
  desktop is an even greater load, and some PCs simply can't keep up. Your PC
  is probably too slow if the movement of windows lags behind the movement of
  the mouse's cursor. To reduce the workload, you can turn off the display of
  windows's contents while they're being moved. Gnome's default window manager
  - Metacity - offers an option in GConf named "reduced resources", which turns
  off some of the "eye candy" effects, with a performance improvement. Read
  your window manager's documentation to confirm if it offers a similar option,
  and how to turn it on (and off).</p>

  <p>This section relies on your contributions! If have some tips and tricks
  that you would like to be shown in the newsletter, <em>please</em> post them
  on the forums.</p>

  <h2>Focus On Package(s)</h2>

  <h3>Code Browser</h3>

  <p><a href="http://code-browser.sourceforge.net/">Code Browser</a> is a text
  editor whose main purpose is editing source code. It supports folding, a
  feature of many editors that allows sections of code to be folded and
  restored. Folding of a section of code results in only the first part of the
  section being visible, allowing you to focus more closely on specific
  sections. Code Browser has an option that I've not seen in an editor before -
  it can display the code in a tree view. Working on a section of code requires
  you to navigate the tree and click on the node which contains the source
  code. The tree view is useful because it gives illustrates the overall
  structure of your code. What's really interesting about Code Browser is that
  it does this without changing the structure of the text or code you're
  working on. It simply adds special markers in the form of comments. Please
  look at the screenshot below and, if you're interested, look at Code
  Browser's home page. For those that love both Windows <strong>and</strong>
  Linux, Code Browser is available for both platforms. Thanks to ryuo for
  discovering and packaging Code Browser.</p>
