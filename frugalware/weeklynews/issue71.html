  <h2><img src="http://frugalware.org/images/newsletter/event.png" align=
  "left">Events etc</h2>

  <p>Here's a selection of recent events and other items that you might find
  interesting:</p>

  <h3>Helicon is alive again!</h3>

  <p>Helicon, Frugalware's X86_64 build server, was recently brought back to
  life with extensive hardware replacements. The server had had some hardware
  fail about 12 months ago and so had been turned off until now. With a new
  brain, Helicon is again back in service, reading and willing to build
  packages for the x64 architecture, 24 x 7.</p>

  <h3>Frugalware 1.4 code-name 'Nexon'</h3>

  <p>After reading through his "Great Big Guide to All Things Asimov",
  Frugalware lead developer VMiklos decided that Frugalware release 1.4 will be
  code-named 'Nexon'. According to the standard timetable, it will take us
  about 6 months to reach our next interstellar destination. Until then, please
  remain seated, and ensure that your safety belt is on at all times. For your
  pleasure we will be showing all 2,342,428 Star Trek episodes on the
  entertainment system. Look out for the classic scene in which Captain Kirk
  issues the immortal words "Spock...<em>I</em> am your father." There is no
  need for headphones as the video and audio will be streamed directly to your
  consciousness. Enjoy! (or not :P).</p>

  <h3>Botchchikii's first Frugalbuild</h3>

  <p>Frugalware user Botchchikii has taken a break from dancing with wolves to
  submit a FrugalBuild for Qtm, a blogging application which supports many of
  the major blogging platforms. If you don't know how he spends his time when
  he's not packaging applications, please refer to recent interviews <a href=
  "http://www.frugalware.org/newsletter/60">here and <a href=
  "http://bloggate.fr/linux/frugalware/entretien-avec-botchchikii">here</a>. The
  Frugalbuild has already been reviewed by Frugalware packaging experts
  bouleetbil and Devil505 and the signs are very good so far. Well done,
  Botchchikii, and we hope this is the first of many FrugalBuilds. Just
  remember to keep those wolves away from your door!</p>

  <h3>Pingax delivers more FrugalBuilds</h3>

  <p>Frugalware user Pingax has submitted more FrugalBuilds, this time for an
  applications rhythmarty ("Plugin for Rhythmbox which allow browsing by album
  art display." and nautilus-terminal ("Integrate a terminal in Nautilus").
  Keep up the good work, Pingax.</p>

  <h3>xz is great!</h3>

  <p>In newsletter issue I mentioned that we were switching to the LZMA2
  compression method with the 'xz' utility. As an example of the difference
  this can make to package sizes, here are the sizes of binary packages for
  Opera (from the official web site, not the Frugalware repositories):</p>

  <ul>
    <li>opera-10.70-9048.i386.linux.tar.gz - 14 Mb</li>

    <li>opera-10.70-9048.i386.linux.tar.bz2 - 12 Mb</li>

    <li>opera-10.70-9048.i386.linux.tar.xz - 10 Mb</li>
  </ul>

  <p>It may not appear to be a big difference in this example, but when you
  consider how many times each package is transferred over the Internet, to the
  various mirrors and users' PCs and servers, it can make a big difference.
  It's especially important to consider that many people may still be using
  dial-up Internet access methods, or be charged according to the amount they
  download. Reducing the size of all packages helps not just these people, but
  every user of Frugalware.</p>

  <p>The mathematical data in this item is dedicated to Elentir, Frugalware
  developer and mathematician. I hope that a few figures might excite him, even
  though there were no complex computations involved. :P</p>

  <h3>Texlive</h3>

  <p>TeX Live is a complete TeX distribution, which provides all the tools
  necessary to edit documents in LaTeX format and output these to various
  formats. Frugalware developer Elentir packaged TeX Live as a replacement for
  teTeX. Recent .tex files require LaTeX packages available in Texlive but not
  in teTeX so the addition of Texlive to Frugalware was necessary. Thanks to
  Elentir's work this problem is solved.</p>

  <h3>Faenza icon set for GNOME</h3>

  <p>If I remember correctly, I haven't ever mentioned an icon set in the
  Events etc. section before but the <a href=
  "http://tiheum.deviantart.com/art/Faenza-Icons-173323228">Faenza</a> set is
  very special. The icons are generally square which may sound strange but
  visually works well, resulting in a very neat desktop layout. Each icon is
  quite unique, with some great choices of icon design for various
  applications. The Thunderbird icon features the Thunderbird logo on a stamp,
  the Firefox logo is the eye of a fox and the launcher icon is a styled
  rocket. The Faenza icon set features monochrome icons for the notification
  area of the GNOME desktop, both in dark and light colours to suit both a
  light and dark panel. Monochrome notification icons are designed to still
  provide all necessary information about such things as wireless signal
  strength, time and battery life, but without being distracting. I think the
  design and overall effect of the Faenza icons is just amazing. Try it for
  yourself and see what it does for your own desktop environment.</p><img src=

  <h2><img src="http://frugalware.org/images/newsletter/tip.png" align=

  <p><b>Disclaimer</b> - Be aware that the hints &amp; tips provided here have
  NOT been tested and so come with no warranty.</p>

  <h3>tar and xz</h3>

  <p>'xz' is the standard extension for an archive which uses the LZMA2
  compression method. In the "Events etc." section above, I mentioned that the
  official Opera builds are available in this format. To uncompress such an
  archive in a terminal, you could use the command:</p>
  <pre>
tar xJvf archive.tar.xz
</pre>

  <p>When you're typing this command you could use BASH's tab completion
  feature (assuming you're using the BASH shell) and type "tar xvJf ", then the
  first few unique characters of the archive's name, then press the [Tab] key
  and the archive's name should be automatically completed for you. The same
  method works for all archive types. For a .tar.gz archive you would start
  with "tar xvzf" and for a tar.bz2 archive you would start with "tar xvjf". In
  these examples, it's the third letter in the tar parameter which indicates
  the archive type.</p>

  <p>It's easy to type the wrong parameters to tar, using a 'j' instead of a
  'J', for example, but BASH's autocompletion helps identify your mistake. If
  you have used the wrong parameter, BASH's autocompletion of the archive's
  name will not work. When this happens, it tells you that you have entered the
  wrong character for the archive type. When you correct that flag, filename
  completion will work as expected.</p>

  <p>This section relies on your contributions! If you have some tips and
  tricks that you would like to be shown in the newsletter, <em>please</em>
  post them on the forums.</p>

  "left">Focus On Package(s)</h2>

  <h3>Pinta</h3>

  <p><a href="http://pinta-project.com/">Pinta is a clone of Paint.NET, a
  bitmap image creation and editing application which is popular on Windows.
  Like Paint.NET, Pinta provides an excellent array of functions and features
  in a easy-to-use user interface. Unlike The Gimp, for example, the panels
  which contain various tools are contained within the main window and can be
  hidden, either automatically appearing when the mouse cursor is hovered over
  it, or always visible for easy access. It offers functions which are
  considered standard in any image editing application, including: resizing,
  rotation, cropping, layers, and a wide range of colour adjustment tools. It
  also features a large range of image effects, including several which are
  useful for anyone who does a lot of photo editing, with red eye removal just
  one of the predefined effects. If you're editing photos of people, you might
  want to use the blur effect quite heavily if they're ugly, or the sharpen
  effect if they're good looking. Whether you're creating bitmap images or
  editing photos, please try Pinta.</p><img src=
