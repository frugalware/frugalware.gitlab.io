<h2>Tips and tricks</h2>
<ul>
	<li>
		<h3>Using the 'Windows' key in Gnome/Metacity - submitted by 'detto'</h3>
	<p>
	I'm used to use the Windows key("hyper" or "mod4") but gnome-keybinding-properties didn't quite work with it. It is impossible to set "hyper"/"mod4" as it captures one key only (calling it "Super_L") with no combination (i.e. I press mod4+ctrl+a to be my shortcut and all I get is "Super_L").
	</p>
	<p>
	To make this button work, one has to open gnome-keyboard-properties, go to the third tab, pull down the option "Alt/Win key behaviour" and change it to "hyper is mapped to the windows key".
	</p>
	</li>
</ul>
	<p>
	This section relies on your contributions! If have some tips and tricks that you would like to be shown in the newsletter, <b><u><i>please</i></u></b> post them on the forums in the Tips and Tricks section!

<h2>Bug fixes</h2>
<p>
Strange but true!  A bug was recently found in the "Bug fixes" section of the newsletter.  The link provided in previous newsletters worked only if you were logged into the Bug Tracker System at the time.  If you were not, the report you saw was incorrect.  Thanks go to Miklos for helping to correct the bug.
