<h2>News</h2>
<p>
	There has been some interesting stuff happening in Frugalware. Here's a small overview of the best things:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		<h3>Homepage design contest!</h3>
		We are running a contest to make a design for the next version of our homepage! I (Alex) decided that there's bound to be a better web designer out there than me, so therefore we are giving you the opportunity to put any web designing skills you may have to a good use, and help your favourite distro :)<br /><br />
		
		The rules are as follows:
		<ul>
			<li>No proprietary content such as Flash animations</li>
			<li>The design must use CSS for layout and not tables</li>
			<li>The design must use the official Frugalware logo</li>
			<li>The design must be compatible with all browsers</li>
			<li>Both the HTML and the CSS should pass W3C validation</li>
		</ul>
		<br />
		The closing date for entries is 1st June 2007. If you have an entry, you can either send it to the Frugalware-devel mailing list or visit IRC and poke AlexExtreme.<br /><br />
		
		The prize for the contest is eternal fame and glory from having credit given to you on the site, and a big bag of cookies from the developers :)

		<h3>OpenOffice.org 2.2 in current</h3>
		The brand new OpenOffice.org 2.2 release was uploaded to current last week, with a new 'kerning' feature which improves the appearance of proportial fonts, and the ability to create bookmarks in PDF files.
	</li>
	<li>
		<h3>Pacman-G2 changes</h3>
		The library behind pacman-g2 has been renamed to libpacman to make it more generic, as we hope that pacman-g2 will be suitable for use in any distro. Also, we have added some new C# bindings for libpacman, so that C# developers can use the awesome power of pacman-g2 in their apps :)
	</li>
	<li>
		<h3>A new way to translate Frugalware to your language</h3>
		We now have a new web interface for translating our projects into your language! You can find out how to use begin translating with the new <a href="http://frugalware.org/docs/translations">documentation page on translating</a>.
	</li>
	<li>
		<h3>Support for Xorg 6.x removed</h3>
		The symlinks to provide support for legacy apps which expect to find X under /usr/X11R6 have been removed. If you use any third-party apps which depend on this symlink, you should update them.
	</li>
	<li>
		<h3>UTF-8 support for ncurses</h3>
		We have added the ncursesw libraries to the ncurses package to provide UTF-8 support.
	</li>
	<li>
		<h3>Lots of work on the new GUI tools</h3>
		A lot of work has been done on some new GUI administration tools for 0.7. First up is GFpm, a replacement for the slow and outdated Frugalpkg. This one is written entirely in C using libpacman, making it much, much faster. Next is GNetConfig, a GUI for managing your network settings and creating network profiles. Finally, a new system tray icon is being created that'll allow for easy switching of network profiles. Of course, there are more tools to come, plus a control center shell to launch all the other tools.
	</li>
</ul>

<h2>Tips and tricks</h2>
<p>
	Here are some tips and tricks that have been discovered by our users to help make using your Frugalware system even easier and make your system even faster:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		<h3>Backup a list of packages installed</h3>
		Include the output of 'pacman-g2 -Qi' as part of your backup routine. If you find that a package sync/upgrade/removal breaks something you then have a record of the installed packages at a point in time.  Again get the output of 'pacman-g2 -Qi', compare them (with the 'diff' tool) and you have somewhere to start in working out where things went wrong. Thanks to phayz for this tip!
	</li>
	<li>
		<h3>Hiding specific desktop icons in XFCE.</h3>
		Some of you might not like to see Filesystem (mounted drives) icons or device icons or even the Home icon on your desktops. Heres how you can hide them:<br /><br />
		
		Create a file named 'xfdesktoprc' in /home/your_user_name/.config/xfce4/desktop
		and add the following lines to it:<br /><br />
		<code>
		[file-icons]<br />
		show-filesystem=false<br />
		show-home=false<br />
		show-removable=false<br /><br />
		</code>
		After making the changes, make sure you logout and re-login into Xfce. Thanks to priyank for this tip!
	</li>
	<li>
		<h3>Converting WMA files to MP3.</h3>
		To convert a .wma file to mp3 format, do this:<br />
		(Note: you will need lame and mplayer installed.)<br /><br />
		
		<code>
			$ mplayer -ao pcm:waveheader filename.wma<br />
			$ lame -b 128 -h -m s -V 4 audiodump.wav
		</code><br /><br />
		You should then see a file called audiodump.wav.mp3. Just rename it to your filename.mp3<br /><br />
		You can change the bitrate by changing the value of -b option to lame.<br />
		eg: for converting at a bitrate of 256kbps, use -b 256. Thanks to priyank for this tip!
