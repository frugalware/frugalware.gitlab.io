  <h2>Welcome</h2>

  <p>The newsletter's aim is to keep you up to date with what's happened
  recently in the world of the Linux distribution 'Frugalware'.</p>

  <p>Features of this issue include:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>KDE 4.3 is coming to a repository near you!</li>

    <li>Frugalware 1.1 will feature new artwork</li>

    <li>Frugalware 1.1 release party - update</li>

  </ul>


  <h2>Events etc</h2>

  <p>Here's a selection of events which have occurred since the previous
  newsletter:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <h3>Frugalware 1.1rc2</h3>

      <p>On 18 August 2009, VMiklos <a href=
      "http://frugalware.org/news/143">announced</a> the release of Frugalware
      1.1rc2, the last release candidate for 1.1. Between now and the final
      release, only bug fixes are being applied, so that 1.1 is as bug-free as
      possible. If you have the bandwidth and time available, <em>please</em>
      download and test this release. To all those who have recently reported
      bugs, thankyou for taking the time to do so because it helps to improve
      Frugalware's quality.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <h3>KDE 4.3 is coming to a repository near you!</h3>

      <p>There are many KDE users amongst the Frugalware community, and they've
      been hoping to see KDE 4 available in the repositories since it was
      released. Their requests and patience are soon to be rewarded because KDE
      4.3 is being packaged. Unfortunately it won't be available in Frugalware
      version 1.1 because that version is closed to new packages. Be patient
      just a little longer, and it will be available in all its beauty.
      (<strong>Note:</strong> This announcement was funded by the letters 'K'
      and 'Q' :P ).</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <h3>Frugalware 1.1 will feature new artwork</h3>

      <p>Each Frugalware release features new artwork, and work is almost
      complete for 1.1. The basis of this release's artwork is a fantastic
      space-themed wallpaper created by Centuri0. If you haven't already seen
      it, look at the <a href=
      "http://ftp.frugalware.org/pub/other/artwork/wallpaper/1.1.jpg">4:3</a> ratio one or the
      <a href=
      "http://ftp.frugalware.org/pub/other/artwork/wallpaper/1.1wide.jpg">16:9</a> one</a>.
      Many thanks to Centuri0 and all those who have adapted this to the
      various desktop environments. Thanks to them, Getorin is going to look
      very good.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <h3>Pulseaudio is now in the 'current' repository</h3>

      <p><a href="http://www.pulseaudio.org/">Pulseaudio</a> is a sound server which can accept input from multiple
      sources and output to multiple targets - including other processes.
      It allows for more advanced sound input and output processing than
      has been possible until now.  It provides for compatibility with older
      audio systems, like ESD and OSS.</p>

      <p>As listed on PulseAudio's home page, below are some of its features:
      <p>

      <ul>
        <li>Per-application volume controls</li>
        <li>An extensible plugin architecture with support for loadable modules</li>
        <li>Compatibility with many popular audio applications</li>
        <li>Support for multiple audio sources and sinks</li>
      </ul>

      <p>PulseAudio and other improvements mean that more people are using Linux as an audio production platform.</p>

    <li>
      <h3>wicd is now in the 'current' repository</h3>

      <p><a href="http://wicd.sourceforge.net/">wicd</a>, pronounced like
      the English word "wicked", is a network configuration utility. Frugalware
      already includes 'netconfig' and its GUI equivalent, 'gnetconfig'. Why,
      then, include another utility? The answer is mainly - "for advanced
      wireless network support". wicd is especially good for PCs which
      regularly move between wireless networks - netbooks, for example. Note
      that wicd is not replacing netconfig and gnetconfig but instead is an
      alternative that you can use if you prefer it.</p>

      <p>As listed on wicd's home page, here are some of its features:</p>

      <ol>
        <li>No Gnome dependencies (although it does require GTK), so it is easy
        to use in XFCE, Fluxbox, Openbox, Enlightenment, etc.</li>

        <li>Ability to connect to wired and wireless networks</li>

        <li>Profiles for each wireless network and wired network</li>

        <li>Many encryption schemes, some of which include WEP/WPA/WPA2 (and
        you can add your own)</li>

        <li>Remains compatible with wireless-tools</li>

        <li>Tray icon showing network activity and signal strength</li>

        <li>A full-featured console interface</li>
      </ol>
    </li>

    <li>
      <h3>Newsletter issue 50 delay</h3>

      <p>I apologise for the long delay on newsletter issue 50's release. My
      spare time has recently been limited, so it's taken me longer than I
      would have liked to complete this issue.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <h3>Frugalware 1.1 release party - update</h3>

      <p>Some people who are interested in attending the 1.1 release party have
      been saying that they'd like more food on the menu. After much thought, a
      new item has been added to the entr&eacute;e.  This is a classic French dish, known worldwide - <a href=
      "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_fries">French Fries</a>.</p>
    </li>
  </ul>


  <h2>Getting To Know You</h2>

  <p>In this section of the newsletter, we get to know Frugalware Linux a
  little at a time. This is not meant to replace the official documentation but
  instead make it easier to read. This should suit those those people who, like
  me, have short attention spans. :)</p>

  <h3>'Nobuild' packages</h3>

  <p>Some software - such as Opera and Skype - has a licence which doesn't
  allow it to be distributed in binary format. The only option available
  is to download, compile and install from the original source code. "repoman"
  makes this task easier because it automates the entire process. To have Skype
  installed, for example, you would enter the command:</p>
  <pre>
    repoman merge pkg
  </pre>

  <p>Packages such as these are known as "nobuild" packages, because we can't
  build and distribute them. For full details of repoman, read its man
  page.</p>


  <h2>New Packages</h2>

  <p>In this new section of the newsletter I'll highlight some new packages
  which have been added since the previous issue.<p>

  <h2>Tips and tricks</h2>

  <p><b>Disclaimer</b> - Be aware that the hints &amp; tips provided here have
  NOT been tested and so come with no warranty.</p>

  <h3>Existing package files\</h3>
  <p>If you installed software manually, or created a configuration file, you
  might find that pacman-g2 fails when installing a package with the following
  error message:</p>
  <p>
    <pre>
    error: failed to commit transaction (conflicting files)
    scribes: /usr/bin/scribes exists in filesystem
    </pre>
  </p>
  <p>The package can't be installed as normal because the package contains a
  file which is already in the file system.  The best method of fixing such an
  error is to undo whatever changes created the problem.  Once that's complete
  you should be able to successfully install the package.</p>

  <p>This section relies on your contributions! If have some tips and tricks
  that you would like to be shown in the newsletter, <em>please</em> post them
  on the forums.</p>


  <h2>Focus On Package(s)</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>Regular expression based find &amp; replace</li>
    <li>Powerful syntax highlighting and bracket matching</li>
    <li>Code and text folding</li>

  <h2>Security announcements</h2>

  <p><b>Remember</b> - According to the normal support arrangements for
  Frugalware, the release of 1.0 ("Anacreon") means that no further security or
  bug fixes will be released for Frugalware 0.9 ("Solaria") or earlier
  releases.</p>

  <p>Here is a list of <a href="/security">security issues</a> which have been
  discovered and fixed in the 1.0 release since the previous newsletter.</p>

  <table border=1 cellpadding=5 cellspacing=0><tr><th>FSA</th><th>Package</th><th>FSA Description</th><th>Upgrade To</th></tr><tr><td>FSA616</td><td>kernel</td><td>A vulnerability has been reported in the Linux Kernel, which can be exploited by malicious, local users to cause a DoS (Denial of Service) and potentially gain escalated privileges</td><td>kernel-2.6.28-6anacreon3</td></tr>
<tr><td>FSA615</td><td>kernel</td><td>1) The personality subsystem in the Linux kernel before 2.6.31-rc3 has a PER_CLEAR_ON_SETID setting that does not clear the ADDR_COMPAT_LAYOUT and MMAP_PAGE_ZERO flags when executing a setuid or setgid program, which makes it easier for local users to leverage the details of memory usage to (1) conduct NULL pointer dereference attacks, (2) bypass the mmap_min_addr protection mechanism, or (3) defeat address space layout randomization (ASLR)</td><td>kernel-2.6.28-6anacreon2</td></tr>
