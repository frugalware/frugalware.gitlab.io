  <p>Here's a selection of events which have occurred since the previous
  newsletter:</p>

  <h3>Frugalware 1.3 released</h3>

  <p>On 23 August 2010, VMiklos <a href=
  "http://frugalware.org/news/182">announced</a> the release of Frugalware 1.3
  - code name 'Haven'. VMiklos listed the technical changes since 1.2, all of
  which were significant. Just as exciting as the technical changes have been
  the many non-technical changes, including: new developers, new contributors,
  new planet software, new forum software and the highest ever number of
  wallpapers proposed as the default or 1.3. It's been a very exciting 6 months
  for Frugalware and the next 6 months look even more exciting!</p>

  <h3>frugal-tweak</h3>

  <p>Frugalware developer bouleetbil is developing a new, Frugalware-only
  utility named frugal-tweak. It is a configuration utility, allowing you to
  easily change or "tweak" many aspects of Frugalware including: change your
  login manager and Xorg driver, keep up with latest news and check for package
  updates. It's development is very active so please try it and provide feedback
  to bouleetbil.</p>

  <h3>bouleetbil - is there only one?</h3>

  <p>I have concluded that there are in fact two people named bouleetbil, both
  who are members of the Frugalware development team. It simply isn't possible
  for one person to do so much for Frugalware. The summary of committed changes
  for Frugalware release 1.3 indicates the quantity of work he's doing. In
  total he made 2,427 commits. Of course bouleetbil was not alone and other
  developers also made a significant contribution but he got the highest
  "score". :P</p>

  <h3>New contributor - Xarkam</h3>

  <p>Xarkam is a new contributor to Frugalware and has already made some great
  contributions. He/she created a custom Frugalware design for the new
  phpBB3-powered forums, also volunteered to maintain the forums and the wiki.
  Thankyou very much, Xarkam, for all the work you have done so far and we hope
  you continue contributing.</p>

  <h3>New contributors are very active</h3>

  <p>Some of our newest contributors have been active recently, including
  Slown, CenturiO and kikadf. Each of them have continued to contribute new
  FrugalBuilds, including: Clementine, Gejengel and gource. Thanks to these
  people for their great work. You can be sure that we appreciate your efforts
  in making Frugalware a better distribution.</p>

  <h3>Python 2.7 is available in current</h3>

  <p>VMiklos recently updated the Python 2.x series release to 2.7. Since there
  are many packages which are dependent upon Python, all of them had to be
  rebuilt to use the newer version.</p>

  <h2><img src="http://frugalware.org/images/newsletter/package.png" align=

  <p><b>Disclaimer</b> - Be aware that the hints &amp; tips provided here have
  NOT been tested and so come with no warranty.</p>

  <h3>How to make a feature request</h3>

  <p>Feature requests are a type of entry in Frugalware's Bug Tracking System
  (BTS). Of course they're bugs but instead are requests, perhaps for an extra
  feature in an application, or a new application. When you make a feature
  request, please describe briefly <em>why</em> you want the particular feature
  or application. This gives the development team some idea of how much work is
  involved in meeting the request, also how important it is to you. Frugalware
  users feherke recently raised a good example Feature Request -
  http://bugs.frugalware.org/task/4300 - in which he/she gave quite specific
  details about what they wanted and a brief reason why they were making the
  request. Follow these general tips and your request will probably be granted
  by the magical Frugalware genies.</p>

  <p>This section relies on your contributions! If you have some tips and
  tricks that you would like to be shown in the newsletter, <em>please</em>
  post them on the forums.</p>

  "left">Focus On Package(s)</h2>

  <h3>Talika</h3>

  <p><a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/talika/">Talika</a> is a GNOME
  panel applet which allows you to switch between open applications via icons.
  Those who use GNOME may already be aware that there are two other application
  switching panel applets. This applet is different in that it shows only the
  application's icon and it shows a live thumbnail when you hover the mouse
  cursor over each application's icon. The layout uses only a little panel
  space, making it especially useful for netbooks. Another option improves this
  even further, allowing you to group icons so that you see just one icon for
  each application, regardless of how many instances of that application are
  running. If you are running several terminals, you see just one terminal icon
  and when you hover the mouse cursor over that icon you see a preview of
  <em>each</em> of the terminals. Talika is a great addition to any GNOME
  desktop but is especially good for netbooks.</p><img src=

  alt="Screenshot of Talika">

  <h3>etckeeper</h3>

  <p>The /etc directory is perhaps the most critical folder on a Linux system.
  Since this is where all system configuration files are stored, any damage to
  files in this directory could stop the system from working.
  <a href="http://joey.kitenet.net/code/etckeeper/">etckeeper</a> is a
  simple but powerful utility which keeps the /etc directory in a git
  repository. It integrates with pacman-g2 so that when the installation or
  removal of a package requires a change to one or more files in /etc, these
  changes are captured via a git commit. This allows you to undo changes made by
  the installation or removal of packages. Since it's powered by git, you can
  also commit changes you make manually (of course you shouldn't be making
  changes here unless <strong>absolutely</strong> necessary). So go on - protect
  your /etc and install etckeeper.</p>
