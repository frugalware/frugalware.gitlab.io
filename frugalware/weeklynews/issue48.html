  <h2>Frugalware Linux Newsletter - Issue 48</h2>

  <h2>...to inform...to educate...to entertain</h2>

  <p>"Of course I have played outdoor games. I once played
  dominoes in an open air cafe in Paris."&nbsp;&nbsp;Oscar
  Wilde</p>

  <h2>Welcome</h2>

  <p>The newsletter's aim is to keep you up to date with what's
  happened recently in the world of the Linux distribution
  'Frugalware'.</p>

  <p>Features of this issue include:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>New developer - Exceed</li>

    <li>Frugalware Linux 1.1pre2 released</li>

    <li>We have an GSOC entrant</li>

    <li>Getting To Know You - Exam results</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Events</h2>

  <p>Here's a selection of events which have occurred since the
  previous newsletter:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <h3>Mibbit and FreeNode</h3>

      <p>In newsletter issue 31 I gave readers a tip which
      mentioned the web IRC gateway - Mibbit - at which you could
      chat in IRC from within your web browser. Unfortunately
      Mibbit no longer allows its users to access IRC channels
      hosted on the FreeNode network. The reason given by FreeNode
      for the change was that they were getting abusive traffic via
      the site. To fill the gap, FreeNode offer their own web
      gateway - which <strong>does</strong> allow access to
      FreeNode-hosted channels - <a href=
      "http://webchat.freenode.net">http://webchat.freenode.net</a>.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <h3>New developer - Exceed</h3>

      <p>No, this is <strong>not</strong> news that I've cut and
      pasted from an old newsletter, we really do have a new
      developer! Welcome to Exceed, whose contributions so far have
      mostly been audio-related packages. It's a positive sign for
      the future of Frugalware that we have had several new
      developers in recent months. To quote a famous sci-fi phrase,
      may Frugalware "Live long and prosper".</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <h3>Frugalware Linux 1.1pre2 released</h3>

      <p>On 7 July 2009, VMiklos announced the release of
      Frugalware Linux 1.1pre2, the second pre-release of version
      1.1 - code-name "Getorin". As I say about every pre-release,
      please, please download and test it if you can. Any bugs
      found and fixed now means the final release will be closer to
      being bug free.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <h3>We have an GSOC entrant</h3>

      <p>Google's Summer of Code (GSOC) is a support programme
      sponsored by Google (surprise!). The very exciting news for
      Frugalware is that VMiklos has been accepted into the GSOC.
      He will be working on improving PHP support for SWIG. As
      described on SWIG's web site - "SWIG is a software
      development tool that connects programs written in C and C++
      with a variety of high-level programming languages. SWIG is
      most commonly used to create high-level interpreted or
      compiled programming environments, user interfaces, and as a
      tool for testing and prototyping C/C++ software." Just in
      case you don't believe me, follow <a href=
      "http://www.swig.org/">this</a> link and read the news item
      dated 21 April 2009.</p>

      <p>We're not sure just what he's planning to spend the money
      on, but the rumour is that his long-term goal is to own a
      Mercedes Benz 'Kompressor'. Congratulation, VMiklos. Perhaps
      in the future we will get Google's support to improve
      Frugalware. Now I'm a little suspicious of where the 'G' in
      GFpm' came from! Priyank - do you have any comment?</p>

      <p><strong>Note:</strong> Some cynical geeks have claimed
      that the GSOC is merely a beauty competition for geeks. I
      know for certain that this is NOT true; I've seen photos of
      VMiklos! :P (No, not <strong>those</strong> types of photos,
      just the normal photo of his face.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <h3>Newsletter "Updates" section says farewell</h3>

      <p>I have removed the "Updates" section of the newsletter,
      possibly permanently. The section simply wasn't what I had
      been hoping and trying to achieve. Instead I plan to
      introduce a section which highlights new packages.</p>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Getting To Know You</h2>

  <p>In this section of the newsletter, we get to know Frugalware
  Linux a little at a time. This is not meant to replace the
  official documentation but instead make it easier to read. This
  should suit those those people who, like me, have short attention
  spans. :)</p>

  <h2>Tips and tricks</h2>

  <p><b>Disclaimer</b> - Be aware that the hints &amp; tips
  provided here have NOT been tested and so come with no
  warranty.</p>

  <p>This section relies on your contributions! If have some tips
  and tricks that you would like to be shown in the newsletter,
  <em>please</em> post them on the forums.</p>

  <h3>Looking for a package? Help is here...</h3>

  <p>pacman-g2 and GFpm both offer the option of searching for
  packages, by name etc, but you can do the same with Firefox.
  Simply install the plugin - found on the <a href=
  "http://frugalware.org/packages">Frugalware packages page</a> and
  you can then search for packages using the native Firefox
  method.</p>

  <p>To conduct a search, you select Frugalware from the drop-down
  list of search engines, then enter your search criteria in the
  search box.</p>

  <h3>What's happening with project X?</h3>

  <p>For applications and projects that are of particular interest
  to you, it can be very interesting to know what's going on
  "behind the scenes". Many projects - including Frugalware Linux -
  use mailing lists for announcements and discussion. Some mailing
  lists allow only authorised people to send messages, but everyone
  can read their content. Others allow everybody to both send and
  read messages. It's sometimes hard to keep up with the number of
  messages posted, but it gives you an insight into how the
  application or project develops. It's also a method of
  influencing how it develops since you can comment on changes or
  the development of features. Please pick your favourite project
  and get involved - sign up to one of their mail lists.</p>

  <h3>Bisigi Project</h3>

  <p>I want to first emphasise that the Frugalware artwork team,
  whose work can be viewed at <a href=
  "http://frugalware-art.org/">http://frugalware-art.org/</a> is
  excellent.</p>

  <p>Like many Frugalware users, I enjoy using a good-looking
  desktop. Of course what looks good to one person may not look
  good to another. My preference is for a unified theme, where the
  appearance of GRUB, the splash screen, login manager, desktop
  environment's splash screen, and wallpaper are based on the same
  artwork. I recently discovered the Bisigi Project, which " aims
  to create complete and coherent themes." You can find screenshots
  of all the themes <a href=
  "http://francois.vogelweith.com/?page_id=16&amp;lang=en">here</a>.
  They're packaged for Ubuntu, but they're also available in
  tarball format, so they're easily installed on other
  distributions, like Frugalware. If you also like a unified theme,
  I encourage you to look at these themes. Even if you don't use
  Gnome, you may like to the wallpapers included with each
  theme.</p>

  <h2>Focus On Package(s)</h2>

  <h3>fbterm</h3>

  <p><a href="http://code.google.com/p/fbterm/">fbterm</a> is a
  console terminal emulator which uses the Framebuffer to provide
  an attractive interface, including handling modern fonts and
  displaying an image as the background. The background image is
  actually set using the fbv tool - featured below. This feature
  was added in April 2009 and provides you with a more attractive
  terminal emulator.</p>

  <h3>fbv</h3>

  <p><a href="http://s-tech.elsat.net.pl/fbv/">fbv</a> is an
  application which can display images at the console, using the
  Framebuffer. It's used by fbterm - featured above - to load an
  image in the console to act as the background.</p>

  <p>Thanks to ryuo for packaging both fbterm and fbv.</p>
