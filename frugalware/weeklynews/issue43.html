<p><h2>Frugalware Linux Newsletter - Issue 43</h2></p>

<p><h2>...to inform...to educate...to entertain</h2></p>

<p>"If you only do what you know you can do- you never do very much."  <em>Tom
Krause</em></p>


<h2>Welcome</h2>

<p>The newsletter's aim is to keep you up to date with what's happened recently
in the world of the Linux distribution 'Frugalware'.</p>

<p>Features of this issue include:
    <ul>
        <li>Look out!  He's a maniac!</li>
        <li>Exceed (AKA C&#258;dric)</li>
        <li>Frugalware's artists are people too - Centuri0</li>
        <li>Getting To Know You - newsletter</li>
        <li>Focus On Package(s) - Smokin' Guns</li>
    </ul>
</p>


<h2>Events</h2>

<p>Here's a selection of events which have occurred since the previous
newsletter:</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        <h3>Look out!  He's a maniac!</h3>
        <p>TranzeManiaC, the Swedish translator for Frugalware, took a break for
	 a while due to "a rough period where life kept sidetracking me". We
	 welcome him back and look forward to his work in updating the Swedish
	 translations.  He's also taken up work on several packages and we look
	 forward to the results of his packaging work.  As VMiklos highlighted
	 in the previous issue, each current developer has a very high number of
	  packages, so more developers are welcome.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h3>Exceed (AKA C&#258;dric)</h3>
        <p>In the previous newsletter I mentioned that there had been some
	confusion caused by a developer and contributor whose first names were
	 very similar - C&#258;dric and Cedrick. C&#258;dric very kindly decided to
	 resolve this confusion by giving himself the nickname "Exceed".  Thanks
	  for resolving this confusion, C&#258;dric...oops, I mean Exceed.</p>
    </li>
</ul>


<h2>Updates</h2>

<p>Here is a selection of packages which have been updated since the previous
newsletter:</p>

    </td>
    <td>1.2.14-1</td>
    <td>Version bump.  Editor's comment - I've included this one mainly because
    I can't believe the naming of the products that this is based on - from
    tintin to cancan to powwow.  :)</td>

    <td>Library for fast arithmetic with dense matrices over F(2)</td>
    <td>20090409-1</td>
    <td>Version bump. Editor's comment - Does anyone understand what this means?
     I didn't fail mathematics, but I don't know what a "dense matrix" is, nor
     what "F(2)" is.  Oh well.</td>

    <td>Bullet is a professional free 3D Game Multiphysics Library</td>

<h2>Frugalware's artists are people too - Centuri0</h2>

<p>I recently had the idea of interviewing the members of the Frugalware artwork
team.  This is a quite new team but they've already produced some great work. I
can only draw stick people so I'm impressed both those who, like the artwork
team, have artistic talent. Their role is to make Fruagalware look good and this
is not quite as easy as it you might think.  I hope you enjoy this series of
interviews.</p>

<dl>
	<dt><strong>What's your name?</strong></dt>
	<dd><p>Antoine Ch. I'm 22, and I'm a student.</p></dt>

	<dt><strong>What's your IRC/forum nickname?</strong></dt>
	<dd><p>Centuri0</p></dt>

	<dt><strong>In what country do you live?</strong></dt>
	<dd><p>France (Lyon7)</p></dt>

	<dt><strong>In what country were you born?</strong></dt>
	<dd><p>France (Paris)</p></dt>

	<dt><strong>Have you always been artistic?</strong></dt>
	<dd><p>I've always loved writing (fiction), and have played the
	saxophone since I was 10, but never did "graphical" stuff.</p></dt>

	<dt><strong>Do you create artwork in other forms - sculpture, painting
	etc?</strong></dt>
	<dd><p>Absolutely not. </p></dt>

	<dt><strong>What operating system(s) do you use when creating artwork?
	</strong></dt>
	<dd><p>Frugalware of course! 1.0 Anacreon, stable.</p></dt>

	<dt><strong>What software do you use to create artwork?</strong>
	</dt>
	<dd><p>I use the .xcf format of the GIMP, Inkscape a little, and nview
	for resizing. Free stuff.</p></dt>

	<dt><strong>Why have you created artwork for Frugalware?</strong></dt>
	<dd><p>When I started using Gnu/Linux, I found that it was easily
	customizable and I loved that aspect. So I wanted to make my Linux look
	 like something I really like. And so, I started to create artwork
	 for myself first, then for the Frugalware community, because it's
	 better to share and more encouraging when people support you.<dd><p>

	<dt><strong>How do you think Frugalware's artwork might be improved?
	</strong></dt>
	<dd><p>Frugalware artwork should be completed, simply, so it will show
	the solidity of the distribution and reinforce its identity.</p></dt>

	<dt><strong>What's the view from your front door?</strong></dt>
	<dd><p>The view from my front door is the front door of my neighbour, so
	 here's a view from my unique window.</p>

<h2>Getting To Know You</h2>

<p>In this section of the newsletter, we get to know Frugalware Linux a little
at a time.  This is not meant to replace the official documentation but instead
make it easier to read.  This should suit those those people who, like me, have
short attention spans.  :)</p>

<h3>Frugalware newsletter</h3>

<p>The newsletter's aim is, as its slogan says, "...to inform...to educate...to
entertain".  Hopefully the newsletter achieves these aims by telling you what's
happening in the Frugalware world, while also educating and entertaining you.
The newsletter consists of several sections, with some sections appearing only
when appropriate content is available:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Events - covers events which have happened in the Frugalware world</li>
    <li>Updates - lists updates to packages which are important, interesting, or
     both</li>
    <li>Frugalware interviews - provides a little personal information on
    Frugalware's developers, contributors, users</li>
    <li>Getting to know you - explains Frugalware bit by bit</li>
    <li>Tips and tricks - provides hints which may be of use to you</li>
    <li>Focus on packages - introduces to you packages of which you may not be
    aware</li>
    <li>Bug fixes - provides a statistical overview of Frugalware's development
    and bug fixing</li>
    <li>Security announcements - makes you aware of security fixes</li>
</ul>

<p>I took over writing the newsletter from Alex Extreme, a developer who left
the project to focus on other things, mainly his school studies.  I continued
his great work because I believed that a newsletter was a good way of
communicating with Frugalware's users.  I hope you enjoy reading the newsletter
as much as I enjoy writing it.  The newsletter only exists because of the great
work of the Frugalware teams, their encouragement and support and I thank them
for this.</p>


<h2>Tips and tricks</h2>

<p><b>Disclaimer</b> - Be aware that the hints &amp; tips provided here have NOT
been tested and so come with no warranty.</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        <h3>Where has all my disk space gone!?</h3>
        <p>Sometimes you'll find that you have very little disk space free in a
	partition. Use the 'du' command to find out just where the disk space is
	 being used. There are often surprises because you may not be aware of
	 log files, or pacman-g2's cache for example.  To get a summary of the
	 disk space used in each folder in  your home folder, you could use the
	 command "du -h --max-depth=1".</p>
    </li>
</ul>

<p>This section relies on your contributions! If you have some tips and tricks that
you would like to be shown in the newsletter, <em>please</em> post them on the
forums.</p>


<h2>Focus On Package(s)</h2>

<h3>Smokin' Guns</h3>

<p><a href="http://www.smokin-guns.net/">Smokin' Guns</a> is a Western-themed
game based on the Quake 3 game engine. If you've ever wanted to play the part of
a cowboy, this is definitely a game for you. The graphics and gameplay are
great and it's under heavy ongoing development.  What can you loose?  Get on
your horse, ride into town and see if you have a talent for gun slinging!</p>

<h3>Meld</h3>

<p><a href="http://meld.sourceforge.net/">Meld</a> is "a visual diff and merge
tool".  I'm a visual person, meaning that I understand something better if I
have it described in pictures as well as words. Meld shows a comparison of 2 or
3 files, highlights the differences between them, and allows you to edit each
file, with the differences being updated dynamically.  It's not clear whether or
not it supports git, so this is a problem if you're using git, of course.</p>


<h2>Bug fixes</h2>

<p>The following table gives you a overview of activity on bugs and feature
requests as at 6 April 2009. In each cell of the table is a link to a detailed
list of the relevant bugs or feature requests.</p>
