</p>
<p>

  <ul>
    <li>Frugalware 0.9 "Solaria" pre1 released</li>
	<li>Frugalware's developers are people too! - krix</li>
    <li>Save money with pacman-g2, cron and wget</li>
    <li>Focus On Package(s) - rxvt-unicode</li>
  </ul>
</p>

<a name="events"></a>
<h2>Events</h2>
<p>
    Here's a selection of events which have occurred since the previous newsletter:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <h3>Frugalware 0.9 "Solaria" pre1 released</h3>
        <p>On 13 May 2008, vmiklos announced the release of "Frugalware 0.9pre1, the first technical preview of the upcoming 0.9 stable release."  This is the first step toward the release of 0.9 - code name "Solaria".  We need your help in testing to ensure that this is a quality release.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h3>Flaker Oats unmasked!</h3>
        <p>In the previous newsletter I announced that Flaker Oats (and jedifox) continue packaging applications.  While on the Frugalware IRC channel I found that in fact "Flaker Oats" is merely the email name of a wonderful person named James Buren, with an IRC nickname of "ryuo".</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h3>Priyank is "studying for his exams"</h3>
        <p>On 15 May 2008, Priyank announced that he'd be taking a break from his Frugalware duties for a month, allowing him to study for his exams.  It seems odd coincidence that his announcement occurs around the time of the Indian Cricket League (ICL).  This cricket tournament has attracted a lot of attention within those nations where it's a popular sport.  Is the timing of Priyank's absence merely a coincidence or has he actually taken a break to watch cricket?  When you add to this the fact that the ICL features female cheerleaders in skimpy outfits, suspicions become even stronger.  On Priyank's return to Frugalware, we'll have to question him on the "results" - whether these were exam results or cricket results.  :)</p>
    </li>
</ul>


<a name="interview"></a>
    <h2>Frugalware's developers are people too!</h2>
        <p>In this feature of the newsletter, Frugalware's developers reveal a little about themselves.  The aim is to show that "Frugalware's developers are people too!"  I thank the developers for taking the time to answer the questions.  There will be one interview per newsletter (until we run out of developers).</p>

    <h3>krix</h3>
        <p>This issue's interview is with krix, whose main role in the Frugalware development team is support of the 64-bit compatibility.  Please stand and hum the Hungarian national anthem while you read his interview.</p>

<dl>
    <dt><b>What's your name?</b></dt>
        <dd><p>My name is Christian Hamar :)</p></dd>
    <dt><b>What's your IRC nickname?</b></dt>
        <dd><p>Well its 'krix' :)</p></dd>
    <dt><b>In what country do you live?</b></dt>
        <dd><p>I live in Hungary, in Kecskemet city</p></dd>
    <dt><b>In what country were you born?</b></dt>
        <dd><p>Same, I was born in Hungary but in Miskolc city :)</p></dd>
    <dt><b>What do you like the most about where you live?</b></dt>
        <dd><p>Huh. Good question. Well I like that my town is a medium sized town in Hungary with about 120,000 people living here. It's so "quiet" here :)</p></dd>
    <dt><b>What do you do for the Frugalware project?</b></dt>
        <dd><p>When I joined the Frugalware project I had just bought a new x86_64 based system (amd64) and I talked with vmiklos about porting Frugalware to -x86_64 archs. We had some discussion and we decided that I should start the porting project. Well I started it and finished it :) It was my biggest step (I mean in work) for Frugalware. Then I did packaging work, creating new packages from source, maintaining a bunch of programs (update, fix, etc). Actually I gained the GNOME package maintainership. I did some C based programming work to pacman2 package manager and then pacman3 (CVS), created package progress bars and other small things for it (check git if want to see a full list :) ) and did some work on pacman-g2 (which is a fork we know). Maybe that's all.</p>

	<p>Ah. I nearly forgot that I suggested an idea to vmiklos at the start of my development. I "forced" vmiklos to accept that we (Frugalware) need a build system which builds packages in a full chroot environment. To take care about system libs and others. He declined that in the first 1-2 round :) But then he saw that it's a powerful tool and is "needed" to create quality packages. And makes "life" easier :) That was an idea from me :)</p></dd>
    <dt><b>What motivates you to work on Frugalware?</b></dt>
        <dd><p>It's a hobby for me. Before Frugalware I did some packaging for a Hungarian based distro named UHU-Linux. I was a contributor there, not a developer (because that distro was developed by a company). I left them for various reasons. And I thought that I was missing something in the time that I was not working on something 'Linuxish*' :) Then I found Frugalware and there we go. I like packaking work, contributing, fixing and other things. It's totally a hobby :)</p></dd>
    <dt><b>What do you do when you're not working on Frugalware?</b></dt>
        <dd><p>I'm working in an IT business. Actually I'm a member of an IT team in my city's cityhall. Basically I'm administrating computers (even win98-winXP for clients and redhat* debian* - win2k3 servers) and solving user problems. I like this too. I like to help users, its a duuuty! :)</p>
        <p>Well I like to go garden-parties with friends and other ppls :), I like to drive, I like billiards and doing such things. Darts maybe :) I like Jack Daniels of course :) Just ask any FW devel "What's krix's favorite drink?". You got a big two letter thing: JD :) I like to watching DVD's or movies, ah and I'm a big Doctor Who fan! :) Listening to music, typically RAP style, Tupac, Snoop. And I think there are other things I do, I just don't remember them now :D</p></dd>
    <dt><b>What's the view from your front door?</b></dt>
        <dd><p>Instead of showing you that, <a href="http://frugalware.org/images/interviews/krixhouse.jpg">here's</a> a view from a window :)  And <a href="http://frugalware.org/images/interviews/krixhimself.jpg">here's</a> a photo of me.</p></dd>

    <h2>Tips and tricks</h2>

<ul>
    <li>
        <h3>Save money with pacman-g2, cron and wget - submitted by 'phayz'</h3>
        <p>Many ISPs offer two download limits per billing period - one for peak time and one for off-peak time.  The aim is to encourage people to download outside peak times, easing the load on their network.  If this applies to your ISP there's an easy way to update packages while taking advantage of the off-peak download limit.  Two steps are involved - (1) run pacman-g2 with the 'p' option included so that it prints out a list of those packages needing to be downloaded, (2) schedule wget via cron, using the file output by pacman-g2 as the input to wget.  For those who don't already know, cron is a means of scheduling an event and wget is a multipurpose, command-line download utility.  Refer to their man pages for full details of each command.</p>

<a name="packages"</a>
<h2>Focus On Package(s)</h2>

    <h3>rxvt-unicode</h3>
    <p>This time the focus is on a terminal emulator named 'rxvt-unicode'.  According the home page, "rxvt-unicode is a colour vt102 terminal emulator intended as an xterm(1) replacement for users who do not require features such as Tektronix 4014 emulation and toolkit-style configurability. As a result, rxvt-unicode uses much less swap space -- a significant advantage on a machine serving many X sessions."  It's a vast improvment on xterm, especially for those who like their terminal emulator looking cool.  Features include fake transparency, dimming of the content when rxvt-unicode loses focus, and perhaps most important, better font support.  One feature is particularly interesting - line spacing.  With this option you can add space between the lines, helping to make some fonts easier to read.</p>

<a name="security"></a>
<h2>Security announcements</h2>
<p>
    <b>Remember</b> - According to the normal support arrangements for Frugalware, the release of 0.8 ("Kalgan") means that support for the previous release has ended.  This means that no further security or bug fixes will be released for Frugalware 0.7 ("Sayshell").
