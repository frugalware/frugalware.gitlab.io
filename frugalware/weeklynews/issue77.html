  </div><img class="face" src="/images/newsletter/calendar.png" width="85"
  height="85"><br>

  <p>Here’s a selection of recent events and other items that you might find
  interesting:</p>

  <h4>ARM porting is complete</h4>

  <p>Developer Elentir has ported Frugalware to the ARM architecture. Supported
  architectures already include i686, x86_64 and PPC so this will expand the
  range of computers on which Frugalware can be run. "Computers" is now a vague
  term because devices using ARM processors include tiny devices such as the
  Sheeva Plug, Seagate Dockstar and OpenRD. Progress on this has been
  absolutely amazing, given the first commit was just a few weeks ago.</p>

  <h4>Centuri0 is officially a developer</h4>

  <p>Centuri0 has made some great contributions to Frugalware as both a 
  member of the artwork team and package contributor. His latest 
  contribution was a FrugalBuild for ebook-tools, "Tools for accessing and 
  converting various ebook file formats". Welcome to the team, Centuri0, and 
  we hope you stay for a long time.</p>

  <h4>Frugalware wiki was upgraded</h4>

  <p>As Devil505 recently <a href=
  "http://frugalware.org/news/201">announced</a>, the version of Mediawiki
  which supports the Frugalware wiki has been upgraded and a catchpa has been
  added to reduce the risk of spam. The wiki is a great source of information
  about a wide range of topics and contributions are very welcome. If you use
  specific hardware, for example, a few notes about your experience can be very
  useful to someone with the same hardware. Hints and tips about specific
  packages are also welcome. Starting with this issue, a new section has been
  added to the newsletter in which I highlight some wiki pages which have been
  added or modified recently.</p>

  <h4>Bulgarian translations are in progress</h4>

  <p>Frugalware user bgalakazam has kindly started translating Frugalware
  projects into Bulgarian. He/she has already translated the home page and the
  most important wiki pages and is now moving on to the installer. Translations
  in Spanish, Italian and French are already very active so the addition of
  another language to this list is very welcome.</p><br>

  <h4>A git web site in an instant!</h4>

  <p>In the previous newsletter issue I talked about tig, a utility which could
  be used as a git repository browser, also a pager for git’s output. There’s
  another method of browsing a local git repository using only git and
  lighttpd, a web server which is tiny and very light on resources. Open a
  terminal emulator and navigate to the git repository you want to browse, then
  enter <tt>git instaweb</tt> and prepare to be amazed! You now have available
  all the power of git’s web-based interface, from which you can browse the
  local repository. This is the same interface you see if you navigate to the
  Frugalware git page - <a href=
  "http://frugalware.org/git">http://frugalware.org/git</a>. From here you can
  browse the git repository’s the tree, viewing individual commits or diffs.
  Read the <a href="https://git.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/Gitweb">gitweb</a>
  documentation to understand the full power of this interface.</p>

  <h4>Make your hobby <strong>their</strong> hobby</h4>

  <p>A geek’s friends and family members sometimes complain that he/she is only
  interested in only one thing: technology. Instead they want them to do what
  <strong>they’re</strong> interested in: sport, socialising, movies, music
  etc. You might think that the only solution to this problem is to give in and
  split your time between what interests you and what interests them. In fact
  there is another approach: take part in a geek activity but make it
  <strong>appear</strong> to be something else completely. In other words,
  disguise what you want to do as something they like to do.</p>

  <p>To properly explain this requires a real-life example, so let’s assume you
  have a friend or family member who enjoys doing puzzles. Here are some common
  puzzles and how you might swap them for a geek activity.</p>

  <h5>Where’s Wally?</h5>

  <p>In the classic version of this puzzle you must find Wally, a man wearing
  red and white striped clothing, who is in a scene crowded with people. The
  geek version can be played in several ways but the easiest is to give
  everyone some sample source code containing a mistyped variable’s name.
  Everyone must hunt through the source code to find the variable which looks
  just like the others but whose name has been mistyped. To make the task
  harder, try substituting simlar characters - perhaps swapping a zero (0) for
  the lower-case lettter O.</p>

  <h5>Spot The Diff-erence</h5>

  <p>In the classic version of this puzzle you must find a known number of
  differences between two similar pictures or photos. This type of puzzle is
  especially enjoyed by children. To <em>geekify</em> the game, swap the
  pictures for two sections of code, before and after a commit, with the goal
  to find the differences between the two. To encourage everyone to play you
  might offer a reward for the person who finds the most differences.</p>

  <h5>Bingo</h5>

  <p>In the classic version of this game each player has a page containining a
  selection of numbers displayed in a grid. Someone then selects random numbers
  within the range of numbers on the pages, with the winner being the first
  person to have all the numbers in a row or column selected. The geek version
  of this requires that you do a hex dump of your favourite application’s
  source code and hand one page to each player. The game can then proceed as
  normal but with the random selection of numbers and letters being done by a
  computer instead of a person.</p>

  <h4>Do you have any tips or tricks to share?</h4>

  <p>This section relies on your contributions! If you have some tips and
  tricks that you would like to share, <em>please</em> post them on the forums
  or the comments section below.</p>
  
  <br />
  <div class="postheader">Focus on Packages</div>
  <img class="face" src="/images/newsletter/package-new.png" width="85" height="85" alt=""><br>

  <h4>minbif</h4>

  <p>IRC has such a long history that it’s the most popular form of instant
  messaging amongst geeks. Unfortunately for geeks though, most non-geeks
  prefer other IM networks - e.g. Skype, MSN, Yahoo. In that situation the
  choice is usually between using <em>both</em> an IRC and IM client or using
  <em>one</em> client which supports both - e.g. Pidgin and Empathy. For anyone
  who is really comfortable with their IRC client of choice, irssi and X-Chat
  being two examples, moving to another client is like having to move house
  when you don’t want to. If you’re comfortable where you are and have
  everything you need, why move?</p>

  <p>In fact there’s another option available: use an application which acts as
  a gateway between an IRC client and the other IM networks. Frugalware has
  packages available for two such gateway applications: Bitlbee and minbif,
  with the focus in this article on <a href=
  "http://symlink.me/projects/show/minbif">minbif</a>. Using such a gateway
  means that you can continue using your much-loved IRC client
  <strong>and</strong> communicate with contacts on other IM networks. You can
  either install minbif on the PC on which the IRC client runs, or use a minbif
  installation on a remote server.</p>

  <p>minbif’s features include:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>Two modes: inetd and daemon fork;</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p>Only IRC commands are used to control Minbif;</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p>IM Certificates check;</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p>Buddies are IRC users;</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p>Add and remove buddies from list with /INVITE and /KICK commands;</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p>Blocked users are bans on the account’s status channel;</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p>Conversation channels are supported;</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p>Display list of channels on an IM account with /LIST;</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p>irssi scripts to increase your user experience of minbif;</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p>PAM support;</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p>TLS support with certificate auth.</p>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>If you’re not willing to let go of your precious IRC client to be able to
  contact others, consider using minbif instead. Read the minbif <a href=
  "http://symlink.me/projects/10/wiki/Quick_start">Quick Start</a> guide and
  you’ll soon be happily chatting with all your contacts, no matter what
  network they’re on.</p>

  <h4>Guake</h4>

  <p>Guake is a drop-drop terminal inspired by the one which first appeared in
  Quake-style games. If you don’t know what a drop-down terminal is, it’s a
  terminal emulator which, when a hotkey is pressed, "drops down" at the top of
  the screen, on top of all other windows. By default, the height of the Guake
  window is about one third but you can increase this or switch into
  full-screen mode with a hotley. Such a terminal is very handy useful when
  you’re doing something and need a command-line interface for something. The
  advantage of this option over a standard terminal emulator is that it doesn’t
  appear in any list of open windows, with a system tray icon as an option if
  you want a visual prompt that it’s running. Guake is not unique, with other
  drop-down terminals available for Linux including: yakuake, and tilda. If you
  work at the command line a lot then I would recommend you try Guake.</p>

  <div class="postheader">Users' Desktop Screenshots</div>
  <img class="face" src="/images/newsletter/desktop.png" width="85" height="85" alt=""><br>

  <p>This new section of the newsletter features screenshots of users' desktop
  configurations. Whether we use a desktop environment or only a window
  manager, most of us like to tweak the appearance of our desktop until it
  looks just right. With almost endless configuration options it can become an
  obsession. The screenshots which appear in this section are examples of what
  you can achieve. You may not like them all but you may learn about an option
  or application that you didn’t know before. If the creator of the screenshot
  has provided details of the configuration, these are provided below.</p>

  <p>If you would like to submit your own desktop screenshot, please submit it
  the Frugalware forums and I’ll copy it from there.</p>

  <h4>Lenezir</h4>

  <p>This screenshot was posted by Lenezir in the French forums on 29 January
  2011 and features the following applications: Openbox, tint2, conky and
  tilda. This is a great example of how the use of a few applications, when
  added to a dedicated window manager, can look as good or better than a
  desktop environment. Thanks to Lenezir for providing this screenshot.</p>

  <a id="imagebox" href="http://frugalware.org/images/newsletter/issue77_userscreenshot_lenezir.png" title="Screenshot of Lenezir's desktop"><img src="http://frugalware.org/images/newsletter/issue77_userscreenshot_lenezir_t.png" alt="Screenshot of Lenezir's desktop"></a>

  <p>If you don’t already know:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>Openbox = Window manager</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p>tint2 = lightweight panel/taskbar</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p>conky = GUI display of system information on top of the desktop
      background</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p>tidla = drop-down terminal like that in Quake-style games</p>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h4>Phayz</h4>

  <p>Since I’m asking others to submit their screenshots I thought I should do
  the same. This screenshot is from my MSI Wind U200 and features a plain GNOME
  installation without any extra applications added.</p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>Desktop environment = GNOME</p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>GTK theme - Dust Sand</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>Icons theme - Elementary</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>Window border - Dust Borderless</p>

  <h4>Translations</h4>

  <p>Depending on people’s workload, the newsletter <strong>may</strong> be
