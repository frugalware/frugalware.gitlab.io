  <p>Here's a selection of recent events and other items that you might find
  interesting:</p>

  <h3>Sorry I'm late</h3>

  <p>I apologise that this newsletter issue is so late. Although there's no
  formal release schedule, I aim to publish an issue every two weeks. The
  reasons for the delay are quite boring so I won't mention them here. Anyway,
  I hope the content of this issue has been worth the wait.</p>

  <h3>Frugalware 1.4 pre1 has been released</h3>

  <p>On 18 October 2010, VMiklos <a href=
  "http://frugalware.org/news/186">announced</a> the release of Frugalware 1.4
  pre-release 1. These pre-releases are a snapshot of what will be the final
  release. If you have the time and bandwidth required, <strong>please</strong>
  download and test this pre-release. The more bugs that are found and fixed,
  the better the final release will be. This pre-release is the result of many
  hours of work by the development team, so thankyou to everyone involved.</p>

  <h3>We need <strong>you</strong> on the artwork team</h3>

  <p>The Frugalware artwork team is responsible for the default appearance of
  Frugalware, including wallpaper, GNOME/KDE theme, mouse cursors, GDM/KDM
  theme and more. They help to select the default wallpaper for every release,
  and from it create the various themes. Right now this team has only two
  permanent members and needs more. You don't have to be an artist to be a team
  member, just someone who cares for Frugalware's appearance. Even if you have
  had no experience, you're welcome, because we can teach you all you need to
  know. The only tools required are a text editor and a bitmap graphics editor,
  such as The Gimp. If you'd like to get involved, and we would really
  appreciate your help, send an email to the Frugalware developers' mailing
  list. Before being able to send an email message to the list, you first have
  to subscribe.</p>

  <h3>Fantastic artwork by Léo</h3>

  <p>Léo Tomas is the creator of the default Frugalware wallpaper for release
  1.0, also the <a href="http://www.bisigi-project.org/?lang=en">Bisigi
  Project</a>. In addition to these wallpapers he has created an entire range
  of beautiful wallpapers and textures, all of which you can find at his
  <a href="http://pr09studio.tk/">online portfolio</a>. All of his work is
  licenced under the Creative Commons Attribution licence, which provides you a
  lot of freedom when using his creations. Below is my favourite of all his
  wallpapers, with which I have decorated my GNOME desktop. Take a look at his
  portfolio and I think you'll agree that he is producing some amazing artwork.
  Keep up the great work Léo.</p>

  <h3>WHYANFC! (Woo hoo, yet another new Frugalware contributor!)</h3>

  <p>If you were wondering if I had simply cut-and-pasted this announcement
  from a previous newsletter issue, the answer is "No". We really <em>do</em>
  have a new contributor - Melko. He has contributed two FrugalBuilds - one for
  Kuickshow, a KDE-based image viewer and Puddletag, an audio tag editor.
  Thanks to Melko for these contributions. Look out for them soon in the new
  packages RSS feed.</p>

  <h3>12 months of Frugalware</h3>

  <p>This year is nearly over, so it's a good time to start planning for 2011.
  To help you plan the year, we have produced a month-to-a-page calendar that
  you can hang on a wall. Every month features photos of a selection of
  developers' and contributors' faces, together with vital statistics. Instead
  of quoting statistics about their physiques, which would be quite boring
  honestly, the statistics are about their contributions, including length of
  time as a team member, number of commits etc. If you would like a copy of the
  calendar, scan US$5 or the equivalent in your local currency and send the
  image to vmiklos_kompressor_fund [AT] frugalwear [DOT] org. If you don't want
  a copy of the calendar, send US$10. With Christmas near, the calendar would
  make a great gift for families, friends and relatives. Honestly, it would
  make an even better gift for your enemies. So <em>please</em>, think of what
  12 months of looking into the eyes of Frugalware's developers and
  contributors would do you for you and buy a copy of the calendar.</p>

  <h3>Kernel upgrade to 2.6.36</h3>

  <p>VMiklos recently upgraded the default Linux kernel version to 2.6.36.
  "What does this mean for me?", I hear you ask. Interestingly, it includes a
  function named UltraHyperSuperBoost (or UHSB) which can improve the
  performance of your PC or server, simply by pressing a sequence of keys.
  After you upgrade to this kernel version, you can initiate the performance
  boost by pressing [Ctrl]+ [Alt]+[Shift]+[F12]+[=]+[*]+[$]+[#]. If you find
  that it's difficult to press 8 keyboard keys at once with just 10 fingers,
  don't give up because it gets easier with practice. Anyone who has used the
  'vi' editor or one of its variants will find it easy to initiate.</p>

  <p>Since I am not an expert in the Linux kernel, I asked VMiklos for an
  explanation and he replied: "The FIFO buffers have been optimised so that all
  register transfers are input in correlation with the memory buffer banks and
  all calls to the bitbucket are instead symlinked to a further array of 42
  pointers." I know it makes sense to someone, but I felt a few brain cells die
  with the effort of trying to understand.</p>

  <h2><img src="http://frugalware.org/images/newsletter/tip.png" align=
  "left">Tips and tricks</h2>

  <p><b>Disclaimer</b> - Be aware that the hints &amp; tips provided here have
  NOT been tested and so come with no warranty.</p>

  <p>The newsletter has featured a lot of hints and tips so I thought it would
  be useful to feature some of the best of the past 70 (or so) issues.</p>

  <h3>Pacman - what did I just install?</h3>

  <p>Sometimes you may quickly install several packages and their dependencies.
  Afterward you think "Hmmm... what packages were just installed?" To find
  out, refer to pacman-g2's log file - /var/log/pacman-g2.log</p>

  <h3>Which packages are installed?</h3>

  <p>Over time packages are installed, upgraded and deleted. Remembering all
  the packages you have installed at a point in time is impossible. If you're
  doing a fresh installation of Frugalware, how do you know just what needs to
  be reinstalled? The answer is to regularly run "pacman-g2 -Qi" and save the
  output: on a USB key, in an email message etc. You can then refer to this
  list if you need to reinstall the very same packages.</p>

  <h3>Searching for packages with pacman-g2</h3>

  <p>A Frugalware user with the nick 'nicalvaro' was recently searching for a
  package matching the description "image viewer". He/she was confused by the
  fact that some packages appeared in the output more than once. Voroskoi and
  VMiklos came to the rescue, explaining that pacman-g2 was actually searching
  for the words "image" and "viewer" separately. Any package which had
  <em>both</em> words in its name or description would appear twice in the
  search results. Voroskoi's suggestion was that in this case the command
  "pacman-g2 -Ss image.*viewer" would have found all packages with the phrase
  "image viewer" in their description.</p>

  <h3>Unwanted packages</h3>

  <p>Often when you install a package, other packages are also installed
  because the original package is dependent upon them. If you then remove the
  package, the dependent packages are left installed, because pacman-g2 can't
  know if you're using them or not. pacman-g2 has the "-Qe" option to search
  for and list those packages which were installed as dependencies but are no
  longer required. Once you have their names you can then decide if you want to
  remove them or leave them installed. pacman-g2 is able to perform such
  "magic" because it records for each package whether it was explicitly
  installed or installed as a dependency.</p>

  <h3>Mirror cracked?</h3>

  <p>pacman-g2 will automatically try to download a package from all the
  mirrors in its list. If a package isn't available at mirror 1, it moves on to
  mirror 2 and so on. Mirrors synchronise with the master packages site on
  their own schedule, with some synchronising more often than others. The
  following web page gives you an overview of the status of all Frugalware
  package mirrors - <a href=
  "http://frugalware.org/~vmiklos/stats/mirmon">http://frugalware.org/~vmiklos/stats/mirmon</a></p>

  <h3>Where has all my disk space gone!?</h3>

  <p>Sometimes you'll find that you have very little disk space free in a
  partition. Use the 'du' command to find out just where the disk space is
  being used. There are often surprises because you may not be aware of log
  files, or pacman-g2's cache for example. To get a summary of the disk space
  used in each folder in your home folder, you could use the command "du -h
  --max-depth=1".</p>

  <h3>pacman-g2's "--ask" parameter</h3>

  <p>pacman-g2 will ask you questions under certain circumstances - e.g. a
  package's file is corrupt, the local version is already up to date, and so
  on. These questions are necessary to ensure that pacman-g2 does what you want
  it to do. If you always give the same response to the same question, it can
  get annoying to answer every time. To resolve this problem, pacman-g2 has an
  "--ask" switch. If you want pacman-g2 to avoid installing packages which are
  already up to date, you would use the command "pacman-g2 -S --ask 32
  &lt;package&gt;". The number '32' means - if any packages are already up to
  date, don't install them. Refer to pacman-g2's man page for full details of
  the "--ask" parameter.</p>

  <h3>Free some space on your hard drive</h3>

  <p>To free some space, you can delete from your pacman cache those packages
  which have been replaced by a later version by typing this as root:</p>
  <pre>
pacman -Sc
</pre>

  <p>To remove <b>ALL</b> packages from pacman's cache, type this as root:</p>
  <pre>
pacman -Scc
</pre>

  <h3>Mirrors, mirrors, speed is the key!</h3>

  <p>When downloading a package, pacman will try to retrieve the package from
  each of the Frugalware mirrors in turn until it succeeds or gets to the end
  of the mirror list.</p>

  <p>To have packages downloaded faster, re-sort the list of Frugalware's
  mirrors so that at least the three mirrors with the lowest ping response
  times are at the top. Now when pacman tries to download a package, it will
  first try the fastest mirror(s) first.</p>

  <p>Frugalware's mirrors are listed in either -</p>
  <pre>
/etc/pacman-g2/repos/frugalware
</pre>for -stable, or
  <pre>
/etc/pacman-g2/repos/frugalware-current
</pre>for -current

  <p>This section relies on your contributions! If you have some tips and
  tricks that you would like to be shown in the newsletter, <em>please</em>

  <h2><img src="http://frugalware.org/images/newsletter/package.png" align=
  "left">Focus On Package(s)</h2>

  <p>In this newsletter issue, the focus is on native Linux games. For many
  years, Linux users have complained that there are very few good games
  available which run natively. Some have used WINE to run their favourite
  games for Windows, but that is not always reliable. Thankfully, the rise in
  popularity of Linux has led to an increase in the number of native games and
  below are some examples. What I really admire about these games is that not
  only is the gameplay excellent, but the artwork is simply amazing. It's
  difficult enough to attract developers to a games project, but even harder to
  attract artists. Congratulations to every one of these development teams on
  the excellent results of their hard work.</p>

  <p>Each of these games are similar in style and gameplay. I chose these
  simply as examples, not because they're the very best</p>

  <h3>The Battle For Wesnoth</h3>

  <p><a href="http://www.wesnoth.org/">The Battle For Wesnoth</a> (TBFW) is
  described on its web site as "a turn-based tactical strategy game with a high
  fantasy theme. Build up a great army, gradually turning raw recruits into
  hardened veterans. In later games, recall your toughest warriors and form a
  deadly host against whom none can stand! Choose units from a large pool of
  specialists, and hand-pick a force with the right strengths to fight well on
  different terrains against all manner of opposition." The game comes with
  many campaigns to play and more are available for easy download. To make it
  easy for anyone to understand the basics of the game, a tutorial is included
  which explains step-by-step all you need to know to get started. There is
  also a map editor included, with which you can design your own maps. Overall
  it's a fun game to play, which is easy to operate and suitable for single- or
  multi-player modes.</p>

    "Screenshot of The Battle For Wesnoth"></a>


  <h3>Warzone 2100</h3>

  <p>"In Warzone 2100, you command the forces of The Project in a battle to
  rebuild the world after mankind has almost been destroyed by nuclear
  missiles. The game offers campaign, multi-player, and single-player skirmish
  modes. An extensive tech tree with over 400 different technologies, combined
  with the unit design system, allows for a wide variety of possible units and
  tactics." (quoted from the Warzone 2100 home page). Like The Battle For
  Wesnoth, this games offers a tutorial so that you can quickly understand the
  basics of the game. As with similar games, the challenge is to develop and
  protect your own infrastructure and forces. To gain new technology, and
  hopefully an advantage over your enemies, you must put some of your resources
  into research. If you have mastered the game, you can download further maps
  and modifications, which allow you to challenge yourself all over
  again.</p>
