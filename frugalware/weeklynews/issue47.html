  <h2>Frugalware Linux Newsletter - Issue 47</h2>

  <h2>...to inform...to educate...to entertain</h2>

  <p>“For true success ask yourself these four questions: Why? Why not? Why
  not me? Why not now? .”&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>James Allen</em></p>

  <h2>Welcome</h2>

  <p>The newsletter's aim is to keep you up to date with what's happened
  recently in the world of the Linux distribution 'Frugalware'.</p>

  <p>Features of this issue include:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Welcome back Crazy!</li>

    <li>Gfpm upgrade</li>

    <li>Elentir's fwife is now more beautiful</li>

    <li>Test your Frugalware knowledge</li>

    <li>Focus On Package(s) - Fotoxx and Picpuz</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Events etc</h2>

  <p>Here's a selection of events which have occurred since the previous
  newsletter:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <h3>Welcome back Crazy!</h3>

      <p>After a break for personal reasons that was longer than expected,
      Crazy's back! Everyone on the development team is relieved and happy to
      see him back. As soon as he returned, he was again updating packages and
      providing advice to other packagers. The world of Frugalware didn't seem
      quite the same without him.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <h3>Move over Michelangelo</h3>

      <p>Frugalware's artwork team have been busy recently, creating new
      wallpapers, splash screens, GDM themes and more, much more. All artwork
      is available at the <a href="http://www.frugalware-art.org">Frugalware
      artwork web site</a>. <strong>Please</strong> get involved in the
      development of our artwork, either by producing artwork or providing
      feedback to the artwork team. Providing feedback is important because if
      you don't say anything, the artists won't know what you do and don't
      like. For example, do you like a consistent theme, so that the GRUB,
      Splashy, login manager, and wallpapers are based on the same piece of
      art, or do you like them being different? If you do provide feedback,
      please say <strong>why</strong> you do or don't like something - for
      example, "I like the XYZ wallpaper because it's consistent with the
      Frugalware colour scheme", or "I prefer a dark theme because they're
      easier on my eyes in a bright environment."</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <h3>"etc"</h3>

      <p>In an exciting change for readers of the newsletter, I added "etc" to
      the title of this section. I did that so that I could write about
      anything and everything, whether it was an "event" or not. I hope to
      think up a better title in the future. Suggestions in the forum are
      welcome.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <h3>What about KDE?</h3>

      <p>If you have read several newsletters, you might have noticed that KDE
      applications rarely - if ever - are mentioned. It's not that I don't like
      KDE, but my choice of desktop is either Gnome or Xfce. In future I'll
      make a special effort to include KDE in the "Focus On Packages"
      section.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <h3>Gfpm upgrade</h3>

      <p>On 29 June 2009, Priyank released version 1.30 of GFpm (Frugalware's
      graphical package manager). Included in this release is a plugin to the
      file managers Thunar and Nautilus, also several bug fixes and
      improvements.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <h3>Elentir's fwife is now more beautiful</h3>

      <p>For some time now, Frugalware developer Elentir has been working on
      fwife, a graphical installer. Note that there are no plans to replace the
      ncurses installer with fwife. In testing fwife, Elentir has produced some
      ISOs which allow you to do a base installation via the Internet. He's
      tested it and is now looking for others to do the same. You can find the
      ISOs to download at <a href=
      "http://utopia.toile-libre.org/fwife/cdinstall/">http://utopia.toile-libre.org/fwife/cdinstall/</a>.
      If you do test, please provide feedback to Elentir, regardless of whether
      it works or not. I've looked only at screenshots of fwife but from what I
      see, she's certainly a beauty.</p>
    </li>

      <h3>The life of a newsletter issue</h3>

      <p>I have had many thousands of email messages asking about how each
      newsletter is produced, so I thought I'd share this with the readers. If
      you're not interested, please skip ahead. For those that are still
      reading, here's an outline of the process I go through about every two
      weeks:</p>

      <ol>
        <li>Enjoy the glory that comes with publishing a new issue;</li>

        <li>Realise that a few days have passed and nothing has been written
        for the next issue;</li>

        <li>Quickly create skeleton of new issue and realise that I haven't
        thought about what to write;</li>

        <li>Sneak a look at Devil505's blog for ideas, taking care to use Tor
        so that he doesn't know I visited;</li>

        <li>Realise that I can't read French, and that the readers will notice
        if I simply cut-and-paste from his blog;</li>

        <li>Start reading through email messages to the development mailing
        list, looking for things that readers would want to know about. Fall
        asleep while reading;</li>

        <li>Panic as the due date for the new issue is only a few days
        away;</li>

        <li>Write as much as I can while on the train to and from work, when
        I've not been put to sleep by the train's gentle rocking;</li>

        <li>Read and rewrite the issue until I'm happy with it;</li>

        <li>Do final pre-release checks of links, spelling etc;</li>

        <li>Publish the newsletter;</li>

        <li>Correct errors that I missed (but were found by developers or other
        readers).</li>
      </ol>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Getting To Know You</h2>

  <p>In this section of the newsletter, we get to know Frugalware Linux a

  <h2>Tips and tricks</h2><b>Disclaimer</b> - Be aware that the hints &amp;
  tips provided here have NOT been tested and so come with no warranty.

  <ul>
    <li>
      <h3>Automate it!</h3>

      <p>I think we'd agree that you're a fool if you keep doing something
      manually which could be done better with a script. If so, please go ahead
      and call me a fool. :( Part of the newsletter is a summary of activity on
      bugs and feature requests. Until recently I have been cut-and-pasting the
      URL from the draft newsletter into my web browser, then cut-and-pasting
      the number from the resulting web page into the newsletter. Since there
      are 6 numbers in the table, this means cut-and-pasting 6 times per
      newsletter. I finally realised that what I was doing manually could be
      done more efficiently in a script. So I wrote a simple BASH script and
      now I can run the script to collect the BTS statistics and produce the
      table, ready to be pasted into the newsletter. The script is very basic
      at the moment, so it would be too embarrassing to include it here. It
      won't win me any prizes in the field of science, but it saves me time.
      Please take this an example - if you find yourself doing the same or a
      similar sequence of commands again and again, consider writing a script.
      You can choose to write it in whatever scripting language you prefer.</p>

      <h3>Where's Linux?</h3>

      <p>Not all of us are lucky enough to use only Linux at home, school or
      work. Often we have to use Windows but, as painful as that can be, there
      are ways of easing the pain. Many open source applications are available
      on both Linux and Windows (as well as others). Examples are: Firefox, The
      Gimp, Thunderbird, X-Chat, gedit, VirtualBox, FileZilla, MPlayer. If you
      aren't allowed to install applications wherever it is that you use
      Windows, you may still be able to run them. Many of these applications
      are patched and packaged so that they can run from portable media -
      usually a USB key/thumbdrive. <a href="http://www.portableapps.com">
      PortableApps</a> is an excellent site which hosts some of these
      applications and a few helper applications. The development hosted on
      this site in particular is very active, with new releases very soon after
      the official project's release date. Keep these applications on a USB
      key/thumbdrive and your time under Windows will, I hope, be a little
      easier.</p>

      <p>This section relies on your contributions! If you have some tips and
      tricks that you would like to be shown in the newsletter, <em>please</em>
      post them on the forums.</p>

      <h2>Focus On Package(s)</h2>

      <h3>Fotoxx</h3>

      <p>For anyone with a digital camera, Fotoxx is definitely an application
      you should try. Its main aim is to allow you to easily copy images from
      your camera, then adjust them with functions including: red-eye removal,
      rotation, trim, rescale, rotate, warp, fix perspective, sharpen, blur,
      remove noise and add artistic effects. I mention "easily" because all
      these are done much more easily with Fotoxx than with a more complex
      digital image editor such as The Gimp. If you have many images to adjust,
      such as when you return from a holiday, it's important that these
      adjustments be done easily and quickly, and that's just what Fotoxx
      allows you to do.</p>

      <h3>Picpuz</h3>

      <p>Thanks to Jercel, Picpuz is now available in the 'current' repository.
      It's a fun game which creates a jigsaw-like puzzle from a picture you
      provide. It was created by the same developer as Fotoxx (mentioned
      above), Dkopp, Ukopp and Watsup - kornelix. You can choose into how many
      pieces the picture is broken into, so it can be as hard or as easy as you
      like. For those with children, it's a great game for them because they
      can choose perhaps a picture of their favourite story or TV character
      and assemble the puzzle themselves.  Either download a picture from the
      TV show's web site or from a site with wallpapers that are suitable for
      children - perhaps <a href="http://www.vladstudio.com/wallpapers/">
      Vladstudio</a>.</p>

      <h2>Bug fixes</h2>
