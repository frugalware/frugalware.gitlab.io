<h2>Events</h2>
<p>
    Here's a selection of events which have occurred since the previous newsletter:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <h3>Priyank is back!</h3>
        <p>After a break of about 4 weeks to "study for exams", Priyank is back in the wonderful land of Frugalware.  It's good to see that he wasn't distracted by the cheerleaders of the Indian Premier League.  :)  Welcome back!</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h3>Polish translations in progress</h3>
        <p>As I mentioned in the previous newsletter, Mateusz Tybura - AKA wujciol - is translating Frugalware into Polish.  The translation work is going well, which is great.  If you see wujciol on IRC or in the forums, please encourage this work.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h3>ryuo's going like a rocket</h3>
        <p>After only a few weeks as an official Frugalware developer, ryuo has been releasing a *LOT* of packages.  In particular he's bringing up to date the ROX desktop-related packages.  Well done, ryuo.  Keep those packages coming!</p>
    </li>
</ul>


<a name="interview"></a>
    <h2>Frugalware's developers are people too!</h2>
        <p>In this feature of the newsletter, Frugalware's developers reveal a little about themselves.  The aim is to show that "Frugalware's developers are people too!"  I thank the developers for taking the time to answer the questions.  There will be one interview per newsletter (until we run out of developers).</p>

    <h3>Devil505</h3>
        <p>This issue's interview is with Devil505, whose main role in the Frugalware development team is packaging, particularly games.  Please stand and hum the French national anthem while you read his interview.</p>

    <dt><b>What's your name?</b></dt>
        <dd><p>Daniel ELEDUT</p></dd>
    <dt><b>What's your IRC nickname?</b></dt>
        <dd><p>Devil505. I know what you think but I'm not satanic. Devil505 is the name of Jake Grafton's plane from "Flight of the Intruder", a book written by Stephen Coonts. In fact I like aircraft :))</p></dd>
    <dt><b>In what country do you live?</b></dt>
        <dd><p>France</p></dd>
    <dt><b>In what country were you born?</b></dt>
        <dd><p>France</p></dd>
    <dt><b>What do you do for the Frugalware project?</b></dt>
        <dd><p>I'm a package maintainer, I'm maintaining mostly games :)</p></dd>
    <dt><b>What motivates you to work on Frugalware?</b></dt>
        <dd><p>A long story, I'll try to make shorter ;) I tried many Linux distributions and finally I chose Frugalware Linux. Why? Because Frugalware is fast, optimized... and it's not so difficult to install it. I quickly realised there were not many French- speaking users. You must understand that it's difficult to get help when you don't speak English, as is the case for many French people. So I decided to create a community website for French-speaking users (France, Belgium, Quebec...). From this, Frugalware got new users and I was proud when vmiklos added a link on the official website. Then I learned to make packages and suggested my FrugalBuilds to the development team. With precious advice from Crazy and Priyank, I succeeded in making (nearly) correct packages. So, the devels accepted me into their team. It's very gratifying to make packages and to see users using them :) Moreover vmiklos and his team are very cool.</p></dd>

    <h2>Tips and tricks</h2>
    <b>Disclaimer</b> - Be aware that the hints &amp; tips provided here have NOT been tested and so come with no warranty.
<ul>
    <li>
        <h3>Get a better looking "man" - submitted by 'phayz'</h3>
        <p>The output of the man command, although useful, is usually quite ugly.  Using Gnome or KDE you can get better looking output from man.  If you're using Gnome, the command "yelp man:[command]" will display in a nice-looking format the man page for [command].  If you're using KDE, entering "man:/[command]" in Konqueror's address bar will display in a nice-looking format the man page for [command].</p>
    </li>
