  <p>"An SQL query goes into a bar, walks up to two tables and asks, "Can I join
  you?""</p>

  <h2>Welcome</h2>

  <p>The newsletter's aim is to keep you up to date with what's happened
  recently in the world of the Linux distribution 'Frugalware'.</p>

  <p>Features of this issue include:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Jump for Frugalware</li>

    <li>Frugalware's developers are people too - Pingax</li>

    <li>FLOSS developers are people too - Marc Kerbiquet</li>

  </ul>

  <h2><img src="event.png" align="left">Events</h2>

  <p>Here's a selection of events which have occurred since the previous
  newsletter:</p>

  <h3>Locris is here!</h3>

  <p>On 8 March 2010, Miklos Vajna <a href="http://frugalware.org/news/163">
  announced</a> the release of Frugalware 1.2 - code-name "Locris". It has been
  a great 6 months since the previous release, with several major improvements.
  Everyone who contributed to this release - the developers, artists and
  translators - can be very proud of the results of their hard work. Thanks also
  to everyone who took the time to report bugs they found, because 1.2 is a
  better release for your effort.</p>

  <h3>Icons added to the newsletter</h3>

  <p>Icons for each main section of the newsletter were recently added to make
  it look better. This is something I have been wanting to do for several
  months, but never quite managed to get done. Soon after I added a task for
  this to the Frugalware Bug Tracking System (BTS), developer Devil505 added
  them. Since then I have replaced one of the icons and made some formatting
  adjustments. I believe the newsletter looks better with these icons added,
  but I would like to hear others' opinions. Thanks to Devil505 for his work in
  adding the icons, without which it may never have been done. :)</p>

  <h3>Jump for Frugalware</h3>

  <p>To celebrate the release of Frugalware 1.2, the entire team has decided to
  make a skydive together. During the dive they will maneuver themselves into
  position to spell out the word "Frugalware". Practice has gone well so far,
  although this has only been in an airport hanger. WebEagle has been given the
  role of jump master, since he's the only team member with skydiving
  experience. If the jump goes well the team will have celebrated in style. If
  the jump doesn't go well then 1.2 will be the last Frugalware release. Keep
  your fingers crossed! :P</p>


  <h2><img src="community.png" align="left">Frugalware's developers are people
  too</h2>

  <p>This is the latest in the ongoing series of interviews with Frugalware's
  developers. This issue's interview is with Pingax, who is a very new member of
  the team. Please read on...</p>

    project?</strong></dt>

    <dd>
      <p>For the Frugalware Project, I started to contribute by packaging
      software (actually only one : dotclear). I'm also a moderator on the
      French Frugalware community's board. I also translate the project (using
      Pootle).
      </p>
    </dd>

    <dt><strong>What motivates you to work on Frugalware?</strong></dt>

    <dd>
      <p>The fact that Frugalware is the first distribution which gives me
      pleasure in learning exactly how a Linux system works. I hope this story
      will live a long, long time :)</p>
   </dd>

    <dt><strong>What do you do when you're not working on Frugalware?</strong>
    </dt>

    <dd>

    </dd>

    <dt><strong>What's the view from your front door?</strong></dt>

    <dd>
      <p>For the last question, I've no photo. I've only Internet access at work

      the neighbours ;)</p>

  <h2><img src="community.png" align="left">FLOSS developers are people
  too</h2>

  <p>Without developers, we wouldn't have the Linux kernel and all the software
  that we run on the platform. What motivates FLOSS developers? Why does anyone
  choose to spend their time writing software when they don't get paid to do
  so? What do developers do when they're not writing software? These questions
  and more are the inspiration behind this new section of the newsletter. Many
  thanks to all the developers who have agreed to this interview.</p>

  <p>Interviews in the next few issues will feature:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>David Siegel - Gnome Do developer;</li>

    <li>Jesse van den Kieboom - gedit developer.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>This issue, we have an interview with Marc Kerbiquet, developer of Code
  Browser.</p>

  <dl>
    <dt><strong>What's your name?</strong></dt>

    <dd>
      <p>Marc Kerbiquet.</p>
    </dd>

    <dt><strong>What FLOSS projects are you involved in?</strong></dt>

    <dd>
      <p>Mainly Code Browser, a folding text editor. I've also published an XML
      parser in assembly and a lightweight OpenDocument viewer.</p>
    </dd>

    <dt><strong>Why did you develop your own programming
    language?</strong></dt>

    <dd>
      <p>Because I like to design programming languages. There is a lot of
      stuff to experiment with in this field. The language I used to develop
      Code Browser is just one among a lot of other experiments.</p>
    </dd>

    <dt><strong>What led to you being a FLOSS
    developer/contributor?</strong></dt>

    <dd>
      <p>I've written a text editor with a rather unique folding system. I did
      it for myself but I thought that it would be also useful to other people
      fed up of long flat text files.</p>
    </dd>

    <dt><strong>What do you like about being a FLOSS
    developer/contributor?</strong></dt>

    <dd>
      <p>I like the feedback I receive from users, it is always interesting to
      know what they like or what they would like in the application. It can
      influence the direction of the development and it really motivates me to
      maintain and improve my applications.</p>

      <p>I also like to be my own boss: no deadline, no feature imposed by
      consumers or by a marketing department.</p>
    </dd>

    <dt><strong>What don't you like about being a FLOSS
    developer/contributor?</strong></dt>

    <dd>
      <p>Nothing.</p>
    </dd>

    <dt><strong>What do you do outside the FLOSS world?</strong></dt>

    <dd>
      <p>Work on non-free software ;-)</p>
    </dd>

    <dt><strong>What operating system(s) do you use and why?</strong></dt>

    <dd>
      <p>Windows XP and Linux. Windows XP is fine when you can manage security
      issues.</p>
    </dd>

    <dt><strong>If people are interested in helping your project(s), how might
    they do this?</strong></dt>

    <dd>
      <p>They can send me suggestions and bug reports by email. Any help is
      welcome.</p>
    </dd>

  <h2><img src="tip.png" align="left">Tips and tricks</h2>

  <p><b>Disclaimer</b> - Be aware that the hints &amp; tips provided here have
  NOT been tested and so come with no warranty.</p>

  <h3>Search and replace text in multiple files</h3>

  <p>A few weeks ago I found that I had made an error in most newsletter issues.
   I had forgotten a word from the same sentence in every issue that had
  the problem, so I needed to do a search and replace. Thanks to sed - the
  stream editor - I was able to fix these errors very quickly.</p>

  <p>Before I explain how I fixed my errors, here's a description from sed's own
  man page: "Sed  is a stream editor. A stream editor is used to perform basic
  text transformations on an input stream (a file or input from a pipeline)."
  sed is powerful as a text transformation tool because of its support for
  regular expressions. It's a CLI tool and is very useful when you want to
  perform the same text transformation often, or as in my case, the same text
  transformation against many files at once. Like many CLI tools, it does one
  job and does it very well. When it is can be combined with other CLI tools,
  it can be even more powerful. Real-life examples of sed's use are
  FrugalBuild files, where it is used most often to manipulate URLs.</p>

  <p>To fix my errors, I gave the following command in the directory that
  contained the newsletter issues:</p>

  <pre>sed -i 's/wrong_text/right_text/g' *.html</pre>

  <p>This command will substitute ("s") <strong>all</strong> instances ("g") of
  "wrong_text" with "right_text" in every file that matches the file pattern
  "*.html".</p>

  <p>This section relies on your contributions! If you have some tips and
  tricks that you would like to be shown in the newsletter, <em>please</em>
  post them on the forums.</p>


  <h2><img src="package.png" align="left">Focus On Package(s)</h2>

  <h3>K3B</h3>
  <p><a href="http://k3b.org">K3B</a> is a KDE-oriented desktop application for
  burning CD/DVD/Blu-ray media. Although it is aimed at the KDE desktop
  environment, it has been used by many GNOME users because of its features and
  stability. When its developer - Sebastian Trueg - began the project in 1999 he
  was unhappy with existing applications. K3B is the result of many years' hard
  work and is a well-respected application in the FLOSS world. Its features
  include creating CDs and DVDs, also ripping content from existing CDs and
  DVDs.</li>
