<h2>Events</h2>
<p>
    Here's a selection of events which have occurred since the previous newsletter:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
    <h3>We're famous!  Almost :)</h3>
        <p><a href="http://linuxoutlaws.com">Linux Outlaws</a> is a podcast which focuses on Linux and Open Source software.  In episode 27 the release of Frugalware 0.8 was mentioned amongst other recent Linux distribution releases.  Unfortunately this segment consists mainly of reading the distribution's name from the DistroWatch site so very little detail was mentioned.  I sent them an email, prompting them to try Frugalware.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
    <h3>Solaria, here we come!</h3>
        <p>The release of 0.8 has meant that the developers can now focus on 0.9.  To guide the journey, VMiklos proposed to the development team a number of goals.  Those that he proposed and were accepted include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>FS#2869 - gservice</li>
            <li>FS#2870 - sysvinit-translations</li>
            <li>FS#2871 - having the usb and tftp installer in fwsetup</li>
            <li>FS#2872 - improving syncd to transfer repoman.conf</li>
            <li>FS#2873 - using gettext for news entries and newsletters</li>
            <li>FS#2874 - improve netconfig to list card descs when asking for iface name</li>
        </ul>
        <p>If you want to know the current status of these goals, look at the Bug Tracker System (BTS) as their task ID is included in the above list.</p>
    </li>

    <h3>Bouleetbil's been busy</h3>
        <p>As was mentioned in the previous issue of the newsletter, Bouleetbil began work in packaging new applications and bringing existing packages up to date.  He's officially won an award for the most number of FrugalBuilds submitted by a newcomer.  Crazy and VMiklos are hoping to take a rest soon.  :)</p>
    </li>
    <li>
    <h3>Bitlbee, Skype and VMiklos - a great combination</h3>
        <p>VMiklos recently packaged version 0.4.0 of his Bitlbee plugin for Skype.  For those who don't already know, Bitlbee is an IRC gateway to other common IM networks - e.g. ICQ, Yahoo, Google Chat.  Thanks to VMiklos, those who need to keep in touch with Skype users can now do so easily from their prefered IRC client.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
    <h3>Package Updates</h3>
        <p>There have been some interesting package upgrades in the current repository lately, including:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Skype has had a major version upgrade in the current repository (only) to version 2.0.0.63;</li>
            <li>FUN - the Frugalware Update Notifier has been upgraded to version 0.2.2.  Does this make Frugalware "FUNner"?</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>

        <h3>Pacman - what did I just install? - submitted by 'phayz'</h3>
        <p>Sometimes you may quickly install several packages and their dependencies.  Afterward you think "Hmmm... what packages were just installed?"  To find out, refer to pacman-g2's log file - /var/log/pacman-g2.log</p>

<a name="packages"</a>
<h2>Focus On Package(s)</h2>

    <h3>Mirage</h3>
    <p>Sometimes you find an application that, while simple, does just one job and does it well.  Mirage is one of those applications.  According to the web site "Mirage is a fast and simple GTK+ image viewer. Because it depends only on PyGTK, Mirage is ideal for users who wish to keep their computers lean while still having a clean image viewer."  Its features include slideshow, rotating, zooming, flipping, resizing and cropping images.  In loading images, it has an option to recursively open all images in a given folder and all subfolders.  It would be particularly useful in handling a new batch of photos from a digital camera.  In brief - if you want an image viewer with some basic image manipulation included, take a look at Mirage.</a></p>

<h2>Security announcements</h2>
