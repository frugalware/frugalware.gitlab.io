  <h2>Frugalware Linux Newsletter - Issue 62</h2>

  <h2>...to inform...to educate...to entertain</h2>

  <p>"My grandfather once told me that there are two kinds of people: those who
  do the work and those who take the credit. He told me to try to be in the
  first group; there was much less competition there."&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>Indira

  "left">Events etc</h2>

  <p>Here's a selection of events which have occurred since the previous
  newsletter:</p>

  <h3>WHYAFD! (Woo hoo! Yet another Frugalware developer)</h3>

  <p>Frugalware user Adrien Ramos (AKA Kooda) had recently submitted eight
  FrugalBuild files for various new packages. As usual, the developers reviewed
  his work and offered constructive criticism. The quality of his work quickly
  improved, with his latest FrugalBuild files needing only a quick review.
  According to tradition, VMiklos called for votes from developers and, since
  all votes were positive, Adrien was officially welcomed to the team.
  Congratulations, Adrien and we hope you're part of the team for a long
  time.</p>

  <h3>Please give feedback to FLOSS developers and contributors</h3>

  <p>FLOSS developers and contributors are not motivated by money but instead
  by the desire to create something that is appreciated and possibly improved
  by others in the community. Since they don't get paid directly for their
  work, they have to judge the appreciation of others by other means - by the
  number of downloads for example. Even better is when members of the community
  provide them with direct feedback, whether positive or negative. If you
  appreciate someone's work, tell them so, perhaps with details of what you
  like especially. If you don't like something, again tell them, but be
  specific with your reasons. Even feedback which you might think is negative,
  "I really like your application, but I get an error message when I try
  function X" can be positive because it provides the developer or contributor
  an opportunity to improve their work. While all the Frugalware team
  appreciate your feedback, this applies to the whole of the FLOSS
  community.</p>

  <h3>Frugalware French community like PluXml</h3>

  <p>The Frugalware French-speaking community's web site - <a href=
  "http://frugalware.fr">http://frugalware.fr</a> - was recently rebuilt using
  an XML-based blog and CMS framework named <a href=
  "http://pluxml.org/">PluXml</a> . The result looks great, minimalistic in
  design but with an attractive choice of colours. This work was done by
  community members Lenezir and McKey. Well done to them on a great result!
  You're a credit to the whole Frugalware community.</p>

  <h3>A text editor in every colour of the rainbow</h3>

  <p>Although I haven't done an official survey, I am quite sure Frugalware has
  the largest number of text editors officially packaged. This long list is
  mainly the result of one person's hard work - Frugalware developer ryuo.
  There are so many editors available in fact that we suspect he is now
  developing editors under false names so that he can package them and add them
  to "the list". No-one knows if this will ever end, but don't be surprised if
  another editor is announced here in the newsletter in the next few weeks.</p>

  <h2><img src="http://frugalware.org/images/newsletter/community.png" align=
  "left">FLOSS developers are people too</h2>

  <p>Without developers, we wouldn't have the Linux kernel and all the software
  that we run on the platform. What motivates FLOSS developers? Why does anyone
  choose to spend their time writing software when they don't get paid to do
  so? What do developers do when they're not writing software? These questions
  and more are the inspiration behind this section of the newsletter. Many
  thanks to all the developers who have agreed to this interview.</p>

  <p>This issue, we have an interview with Marc Lentz, developer of jBrout.
  Thanks to Fred Bezies who translated Marc's interview answers from French
  into English. Without his help the interview simply wouldn't have been
  possible.</p>

  <dl>
    <dt><strong>What's your name?</strong></dt>

    <dd>
      <p>My name is Marc Lentz.</p>
    </dd>

    <dt><strong>What's the story behind your nickname (if you have
    one)?</strong></dt>

    <dd>
      <p>My first personal Internet subscription, in 97, was a subscription
      using a local cable service operator (I never had a dialup connection).
      And as I had to find a unique nickname, it was the shrinking of "man at
      LAN" (badly translated from "men on the network", versus my friends who
      were for the greater part on dialup connection.) At that time, it gave
      few answers on Google, even if it was a mountain range.</p>
    </dd>

    <dt><strong>What FLOSS projects are you involved in?</strong></dt>

    <dd>
      <p>In fact, I do not participate a lot and from time to time to FLOSS
      projects. I send very few patches. I have done documentation (wiki) and
      even translation. But as my hobby is coding, I release nearly everything
      I'm doing using FLOSS licences.</p>
    </dd>

    <dt><strong>What led to you being a FLOSS
    developer/contributor?</strong></dt>

    <dd>
      <p>I "fell" into free software, when I discovered PHP2 in 1998. I was
      pleasantly surprised to find such a good product, gratis and free. One
      thing lead to another and I became interested in this free community and
      everything related to it, going from discovery to discovery. In 2000, I
      was dual-booting with Mandrake and in 2004, I completely switched to
      Linux, with Ubuntu. As free software gave me a lot of things, I found it
      natural to give back to free software, to participate in the community's
      innovation. I'm somebody who is really interested in technology, and in
      free software I found what I was looking for. I learn a lot, and I can
      find others who are passionate about technology-based topics.</p>
    </dd>

    <dt><strong>What do you like about being a FLOSS
    developer/contributor?</strong></dt>

    <dd>
      <ul>
        <li>I like the idea of participating in this incredible bazaar (e.g.
        "The Cathedral and the Bazaar" from Eric Raymond). I like to think that
        maybe I ease the work of other important developers who are working on
        the kernel, by giving people my applications (something like : "they
        can concentrate on their job, instead of losing time building an
        application").</li>

        <li>I love positive feedback from users ;-)</li>

        <li>I love to chat with other free software users on technology-based
        topics.</li>
      </ul>
    </dd>

    <dt><strong>What don't you like about being a FLOSS
    developer/contributor?</strong></dt>

    <dd>
      <p>I didn't realize it from the start, but releasing an
      application/library under a free software licence, and building
      everything around it, takes a lot of time : communication
      (news/mail/forum), documentation, showing sources, packaging, bug
      tracker, mailing list,... I'm not really good at this, because I do only
      the minimum in my point of view. I don't like this, because while I'm
      doing this, I'm not coding ;-) I've a lot of projects in my mind, which
      will never been released, for the simple and good reason, I will have to
      do all the work behind it. Luckily there are solutions like "Google
      Code", or even better, <a href=
      "https://launchpad.net/">Launchpad</a>/<a href=
      "http://wiki.ubuntu.com/Quickly">Quickly</a> which make things a lot
      simpler.</p>
    </dd>

    <dt><strong>What do you do outside the FLOSS world?</strong></dt>

    <dd>
      <p>Listen to a lot of music. In winter time, I practice snowboarding, and
      I try to regularly practice roller blading or mountain biking.</p>
    </dd>

    <dt><strong>What operating system(s) do you use and why?</strong></dt>

    <dd>
      <p>I use mainly Ubuntu. I also have ChromeOS installed on my 2 netbooks.
      And I keep a virtual machine (VirtualBox) running "MS Windows XP" to do
      some Windows tests rarely ;-)</p>
    </dd>

    <dt><strong>If people are interested in helping your project(s), how might
    they do this?</strong></dt>

    <dd>
      <p>I accept patches and ideas ;-). Just contact me.</p>

  <h2><img src="http://frugalware.org/images/newsletter/tip.png" align=
  "left">Tips and tricks</h2>

  <p><b>Disclaimer</b> - Be aware that the hints &amp; tips provided here have
  NOT been tested and so come with no warranty.</p>

  <h3>How to install many packages in one command</h3>

  <p>Sometimes you need to install many packages at once. The simplest way of
  doing this is to list all the packages' names on the command line. If some or
  all of the packages' names have a common element, you can use pacman-g2's
  regular expression support to make the job easier. For example, all of the
  GStreamer "ugly" plugins could be installed with the following command:</p>
  <pre>
pacman-g2 -S --regex gst-plugins-ugly*
</pre>

  <p>The "--regex" parameter tells pacman-g2 that the following string is to be
  used as a regular expression, not a literal string, when matching package
  names.</p>

  <h3>Keep your ~ tidy</h3>

  <p>Your home (~) directory is used by most applications to store
  configuration files in hidden folders (those which start with a "."). Some
  applications store only a few files and others, like Firefox, store a lot.
  When you remove a package with pacman-g2, your personal configuration files
  and folders for that application are not removed. If you never use that
  application again though, those files and folders are simply cluttering your
  home directory. Because you are regularly backing up your home directory (you
  <strong>are</strong>, I hope!) they extend the time taken to do a backup and
  clutter your backup media. Mark on your calendar, or add a To Do item to your
  list, and regularly review the contents of your home directory.</p>

  <p>This section relies on your contributions! If you have some tips and
  tricks that you would like to be shown in the newsletter, <em>please</em>
  post them on the forums.</p>

  <h2><img src="http://frugalware.org/images/newsletter/package.png" align=
  "left">Focus On Package(s)</h2>

  <h3>Parole media player</h3>

  <p>Parole is a GStreamer-based media player developed for the Xfce desktop.
  It has the same design goals of the Xfce desktop itself: simple, easy-to-use,
  yet functional and it achieves all of these. Its features include: support
  for multimedia keyboards, the ability to minimise to the system tray,
  playlist support and the ability to disable the screensaver while playing
  movies. Parole's has only a few runtime requirements so even if you don't use
  the Xfce desktop environment, you still can still use it. Because its focus
  is simplicity, you may need to find another media player if you want advanced
  features but otherwise you really should try Parole.</p>

  src="http://frugalware.org/images/newsletter/issue62_parole_screenshot_t.jpg"
  alt="Screenshot of Parole media player"></a></p>

  <h3>Zenity</h3>

  <p>Zenity is an application which presents GTK+ dialog boxes and returns the
  user's selection as a return code or standard output. Its main use is in
  shell scripts where you need input from the user. If you had a backup script
  for example, you might need the user to specify a date, so with the help of
  Zenity you present a calendar dialog, accept the date selection and pipe this
  into the backup script. Of course this could be done entirely from the
  command line, but Zenity is most useful in helping those who need to run a
  script but are not comfortable with the command line. In the case of the
  backup script, presenting a GUI dialog box not only makes life easier for the
  user but also improves the chance of getting valid input.</p>

  <p>Below is an example of a Zenity command:</p>

  <pre>zenity  --question --title "Alert" --text  "Microsoft Windows has been \
  found! Would you like to remove it?"</pre>

  <p>Refer to Zenity's man page or the numerous tutorials on the web for other
  example uses.</p>
