  <h2>Events</h2>

  <p>Here's a selection of events which have occurred since the previous
  newsletter:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <h3>From Last to Libre</h3>

      <p>Last.fm is a web-based service which analyses what music you play and
      suggests music which you also might like. Until recently it was very
      popular, including within the FLOSS community, because the service cost
      nothing to use. However, some people were concerned about the fact that
      it wasn't a FLOSS service, also privacy protection. Last.fm announced a
      few months ago that it would begin charging users outside the USA, UK and
      Germany for streaming media. This change was something which many people
      could not accept.</p>

      <p>In response to Last.fm's changes, Matt Lee, of the Free Software
      Foundation (FSF) began a new, similar service named Libre.fm. The name
      represents the fact that it's truly free, with no cost to users and being
      licenced under the Affero GPL (AGPL). This is a quite new licence aimed
      at web-based services which collect and store data from its users. The
      AGPL ensures not only that the code to the service's software is free,
      but also that each user's content is available to them, to take
      elsewhere. This is something that most people don't consider until they
      want to move to a different service and realise too late that they're
      "locked in" to a service provider.</p>

      <p>"How does this relate to Frugalware?" I can hear you ask. Frugalware
      has a group on the web-based service Libre.fm, which allows users to
      submit data about the music they listen to via their media player. The
      idea is to allow members of the Frugalware group to know what music
      others in the group are playing. If you play music while on your PC,
      please join the Frugalware community on Libre.fm.</p>
    </li>

      <h3>Farewell to Jercel</h3>

      <p>On 12 December 2009, Frugalware developer Jercel announced his
      departure from the team in a message to the developers' mailing list.
      He's leaving for professional reasons, as his current job, together with
      his other commitments, doesn't leave him enough time to work on
      Frugalware. We will miss him because over the 7 months he was a
      developer, he made made an excellent contribution. Of course we wish him
      well for the future.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <h3>Crazy's back</h3>

      <p>After recuperating in hospital for a while, Frugalware developer Crazy
      has returned, already busy bumping packages. Aside from the large amount
      of work that Crazy does, you have to admire him for his often
      entertaining commit messages, such as:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>* damn , forgot the patch :|</li>

        <li>* arghhhhh<br>
        * that was meant as taglib-extra's' which is already there may</li>

        <li>* Ohh lol die here #Fdie -&gt; Fdie ;)<br>
        * I don't think it was meant like this</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Thankyou Crazy, for helping to make reading the developers' mailing
      list fun. :)</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <h3>KDE 4 is here!</h3>

      <p>In newsletter issue 50 it was announced that KDE 4 was being packaged.
      This was a major piece of work, because KDE 4 was a complete redesign and
      a LOT changed between version 3.5 and 4. Thanks to Dex77, Hermier,
      Exceed, Crazy and Vmiklos, KDE 4 is now available in the 'current'
      repository for everyone to install and enjoy. Even if you don't use it
      now, why not try it out? You never know, you just might switch to it once
      you've tried it.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <h3>I am missing "you"...</h3>

      <p>Each Frugalware newsletter issue starts life as an empty HTML
      skeleton, with each piece fitted into place as it is written. One
      unfortunate result of this method is that if there is an error in the
      template, that error is copied into each issue. This happened early in
      the life of the newsletter, and I only found the error recently. In the
      text which asks readers to contribute hints and tips, the word "you" was
      missing. A search revealed the error in 45 issues, almost the complete
      catalogue of newsletters! They were all fixed quickly, though, thanks to
      'sed'. For someone like me, who takes care that spelling and grammar is
      correct, it was very embarrassing.</p>

      <p>I <strong>hope</strong> that this is the last of any such errors, but
      I need your help. If yoo doo find airnee erruz in thee newzletta, pleaze
      tell mee. :P</p>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Getting To Know You</h2>

  <p>In this section of the newsletter, we get to know Frugalware Linux a
  little at a time. This is not meant to replace the official documentation but
  instead make it easier to read. This should suit those people who, like me,
  have short attention spans. :)</p>

  <h3>Patches</h3>

  <p>Patches are often applied to the original source code of applications by
  Linux distributors. The reasons for applying patches vary but the main reason
  is to have the application behave according to the distribution's wishes.
  Frugalware's policy is to maintain and apply as few patches as possible, for
  the following reasons:</p>

  <h4>Maintenance effort</h4>

  <p>Every patch has to be maintained by the Frugalware development team. When
  a package is upgraded, the package's maintainer must check if all its patches
  (if any) are still relevant. If they're no longer relevant then they can be
  deleted. This process is manual and can take a long time, depending on the
  number and complexity of the patches. In summary, all this time spent
  maintaining patches could be better spent on other activities.</p>

  <h4>Respect for developers</h4>

  <p>A patch is applied to a package's original source code to change its
  behaviour from what the original developer(s) intended. Frugalware's policy
  is to first try to have patches accepted by the original developer(s). This
  means that (1) the original developer(s) accepts the change as being valid,
  and (2) it avoids the cost of having the Frugalware development team maintain
  the patch. If a patch is refused by the original developer(s) then it's not
  likely to be maintained by the Frugalware development team.</p>

  <h4>Troubleshooting</h4>

  <p>Applying patches to a package's original source makes troubleshooting more
  difficult for everyone involved. When a problem occurs, someone has to find
  out if it's caused by any of the package's patches. If the answer is "No',
  then the bug can be reported upstream. If the answer is "Yes", then it's the
  responsibility of the distribution to fix the problem. This extra step in
  troubleshooting complicates the process and adds to the workload of the
  distribution's developers.</p>

  <p>A design principle which Frugalware borrowed from Slackware is simplicity
  and since patches go against this principle, they're used only when
  absolutely necessary.</p>

  <h2>FLOSS developers are people too</h2>

  <p>Without developers, we wouldn't have the Linux kernel and all the software
  that we run on the platform. What motivates FLOSS developers? Why does anyone
  choose to spend their time writing software when they don't get paid to do
  so? What do developers do when they're not writing software? These questions
  and more are the inspiration behind this new section of the newsletter.</p>

  <p>In interviews with FLOSS developers, we get to know them a little better
  as people, and what motivates them in their quest for better software. I'm
  very excited by this new series because I admire their work very much. I'm
  also very grateful to them for taking the time to reply to my requests.</p>

  <p>Interviews in the next few issues will feature:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>The developer of Code Browser;</li>

    <li>Ali Abdallah - Xfce developer &amp; Parole developer;</li>

    <li>Jesse van den Kieboom - gedit developer.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>This issue, we have an interview with Jeff Bailes - developer of Whaaw!, a
  GStreamer-based media player.</p>

  <dl>
    <dt><strong>What's your name?</strong></dt>

    <dd>
      <p>Jeff Bailes</p>
    </dd>

    <dt><strong>What FLOSS projects are you involved in?</strong></dt>

    <dd>
      <p>I'm the main developer for 'Whaaw! Media Player' (whaawmp for short).
      I also do the en_GB translations for Xfce and various other projects.</p>
    </dd>

    <dt><strong>What led to you being a FLOSS
    developer/contributor?</strong></dt>

    <dd>
      <p>I had been using Linux and free software for a while, was interested
      in programming and I wanted to give something back to the community.
      (That and I was sick of putting up with 'color' popping up everywhere). I
      looked around a bit and found that there was a lack of a GStreamer based
      GTK+ media player without GNOME dependencies (ie Totem for Xfce). I
      created an initial version and thought others might like it too so I
      registered it on Google Code, later moving it to its current home on
      GNA.</p>
    </dd>

    <dt><strong>What do you like about being a FLOSS
    developer/contributor?</strong></dt>

    <dd>
      <p>Writing code that other people will use and (hopefully) find useful
      and, if they want, can change the program to their liking.</p>
    </dd>

    <dt><strong>What don't you like about being a FLOSS
    developer/contributor?</strong></dt>

    <dd>
      <p>Not a whole lot, the main thing I suppose is feeling bad for not doing
      any coding for months on end.</p>
    </dd>

    <dt><strong>What motivates you to work on your project(s)?</strong></dt>

    <dd>
      <p>Mainly wanting new features I'd like to see in a media player I use.
      The recent addition of DVD Menu support was fun, albeit the amount of
      code I ended up needing to add was rather disappointing compared with how
      much time I spent on it.</p>
    </dd>

    <dt><strong>What do you do outside the FLOSS world?</strong></dt>

    <dd>
      <p>I'm currently in my third year of a Bachelor of Science degree at the
      University of Melbourne, majoring in Pure Mathematics. My final exams are
      just under two weeks away, so expect at least some increase in
      development after that's done. Though I'm planning on doing a Masters
      degree next year so that increase may be short lived. I also do a bit of
      work at the local supermarket when I have time.</p>
    </dd>

    <dt><strong>What operating system(s) do you use and why?</strong></dt>

    <dd>
      <p>I've used Arch Linux for the last three years. I use it over Ubuntu
      and others because I like its rolling release system, simple updating,
      simple configuration and almost any package I would ever want is in the
      AUR (and no annoying -dev packages). I'm sure there's some reason I chose
      it over Frugalware but I can't for the life of me remember why.</p>
    </dd>

    <dt><strong>If people are interested in helping your project(s), how might
    they do this?</strong></dt>

    <dd>
      <p>I'd say come and visit me in #whaawmp on OFTC, but I don't go there
      nearly as often as I'd like, though if you did you'd probably run into
      Mark__T who helps out a bit as well. Your best bet is to send an e-mail
      to the mailing list (the link is somewhere on the GNA project page).</p>

  <h2>Tips and tricks</h2>

  <p><b>Disclaimer</b> - Be aware that the hints &amp; tips provided here have
  NOT been tested and so come with no warranty.</p>

  <h3>Portable pacman-g2 cache</h3>

  <p>When pacman-g2 downloads a package, it is stored in pacman-g2's package
  cache folder - /var/cache/pacman-g2/pkg by default. If you maintain several
  computers running Frugalware, a portable pacman-g2 cache can reduce the time
  required to download packages. To use a portable cache, edit pacman-g2's
  configuration file (/etc/pacman-g2.conf) on each PC or server with which you
  want to share the portable cache, adding the following line:</p>
  <pre>
        CacheDir = [path_to_removable_media_directory]

</pre>

  <p>Before you issue pacman-g2 commands, you simply insert (and mount, if it
  is not automatically mounted) the removable media. Just as normal, if
  pacman-g2 can't find the package in its cache, it will be downloaded and put
  into the cache. If you then need the same package on another PC, it will not
  be downloaded because it's already in pacman-g2's cache. This method saves
  disk space and time downloading the same packages on multiple
  PCs/servers.</p>

  <p><strong>Note:</strong>If you use this method, please be careful in using
  the command "pacman-g2 -Sc", which deletes old versions of packages. If you
  are maintaining PCs or servers with different repositories, you might delete
  packages from the removable media which you had wanted to keep.</p>

  <p>This section relies on your contributions! If you have some tips and
  tricks that you would like to be shown in the newsletter, <em>please</em>
  post them on the forums.</p>

  <img src="http://frugalware.org/images/newsletter/package.png" align="left"> <h2>Focus On Package(s)</h2>

  <h3>Chromium B.S.U. (the game)</h3>

  <p>As quoted on the home page, "Chromium B.S.U. is a fast paced,
  arcade-style, top-scrolling space shooter." When you run this game, the first
  things you notice are the excellent graphics, sound and music (unless you
  have sound muted :P). A lot of work has gone into the game's artwork,
  including backgrounds, ships and other items (powerup bonuses etc). The
  controls are quite easy to learn and use, so you don't need to be an expert
  games player. Since you have a view of the action from the top, not a
  first-person view, it's easy to keep an eye on all the action. That doesn't
  mean that it's an easy game, because your enemies will do their best to blast
  you into oblivion!</p>

  <p>If you have ever dreamed of living in a 2D universe, making a living as a
  space pilot (be honest, we have all had that dream), then you
  <strong>must</strong> play Chromium B.S.U. If you take up the challenge, may
  all your moves be quick, and may your keyboard be strong. Good
  luck!</p>

  <h3>Chromium (the web browser)</h3>

  <p>As everyone in the world of technology knows, "<a href=
  "http://code.google.com/chromium/">Chromium</a> is the open-source project
  behind Google Chrome." Google's aims with Chromium/Chrome are to produce a
  browser which is: secure, fast, reliable and standards compliant. Firefox has
  long been the favourite web browser in the FLOSS world, partly because of the
  quantity and quality of extensions available for it. Chrome/Chromium also has
  extensions available, but since this is a relatively new feature, there are
  not nearly as many available as for Firefox. Take the time to try Chromium
  and judge for yourself whether or not it's a better browser.</p>
