<h2>Welcome</h2>
<p>
    The newsletter's aim is to keep you up to date with what's happened recently in the world of the Linux distribution 'Frugalware'.
</p>
<p>
    I apologise that, due to personal circumstances beyond my control, this issue of the newsletter is late.
</p>
<p>
  Features of this issue include:
  <ul>
    <li>New Frugalware mirrors</li>
    <li><b>MANY</b> Security fixes</li>
    <li>Frugalware's developers are people too! - Boobaa</li>
    <li>Focus On Package(s) - Openbox</li>
  </ul>
</p>

<a name="events"></a>
<h2>Events</h2>
<p>
    Here's a selection of events which have occurred since the previous newsletter:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <h3>New Frugalware mirrors</h3>
        <p>Since the release of Frugalware 0.8, three mirrors have been created - numbers 2, 7 and 8:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Number 2 - Christian Hamar (ftp/100 MBit), located in Hungary</li>
            <li>Number 7 - botux.net (http/100 MBit), located in France</li>
            <li>Number 8 - linux-de.org (ftp, http &amp; rsync/100 MBit), located in Germany</li>
        </ul>
        <p>To ensure you have the current mirror list for pacman-g2, make sure your pacman-g2 package is up to date.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h3>Are Frugalware's mirrors up to date?</h3>
        <p>Again on the topic of mirrors, it can be useful to know which mirrors are up to date and which are not.  With the help of a FOSS utility named 'mirmon', VMiklos has created a <a href="http://frugalware.org/~vmiklos/stats/mirmon/">web page</a> which details the status of all Frugalware mirrors.  Pacman-g2 will automatically try each mirror in turn when downloading a package, so there's no need to manually edit the list of mirrors.</p>
    </li>
</ul>


<a name="interview"></a>
    <h2>Frugalware's developers are people too!</h2>
        <p>In this feature of the newsletter, Frugalware's developers reveal a little about themselves.  The aim is to show that "Frugalware's developers are people too!"  I thank the developers for taking the time to answer the questions.  There will be one interview per newsletter (until we run out of developers).</p>

    <h3>boobaa</h3>
        <p>This issue's interview is with boobaa, whose roles in the Frugalware development team include maintaining various packages, also some server-side code.  Please stand and hum the Hungarian national anthem while you read his interview.</p>

<dl>
    <dt><b>What's your name?</b></dt>
        <dd>CSÉCSY László</dd>
    <dt><b>What's your IRC nickname?</b></dt>
        <dd>Boobaa - but I will not disclose its story in general public, if that is possible. ;)</dd>
    <dt><b>In what country do you live?</b></dt>
        <dd>Hungary</dd>
    <dt><b>In what country were you born?</b></dt>
        <dd>Hungary</dd>
    <dt><b>What do you like the most about where you live?</b></dt>
        <dd>If you mean the country, my answer is that I was born here, and I can buy a bread anywhere if I ask for it in Hungarian. If you mean some smaller area, eg. the town, the answer is the friends: we can rely on each other, and there are topics and times when we really do so.</dd>
    <dt><b>What do you do for the Frugalware project?</b></dt>
        <dd>I maintain some packages (some games, some server-side stuff and others), and I share my ideas with those who can implement them. This means some algorithms I have learnt at school, but cannot code by myself, for example, or some not-worth-mentioning smallish things.</dd>
    <dt><b>What motivates you to work on Frugalware?</b></dt>
        <dd>It may sound weird from an IT guy but I think that adding my skills to a FOSS project can be a way of serving my Savior, the Living God: He was the one who gave me the opportunity to use open-source software freely (both as a bird and as a beer) as well as to give back some tiny bits of the knowledge He gave me. To be honest there are other, more easily comprehensible reasons as well: it is easier to rely on stuff that I am allowed to bend if I need to - and I really like the fact that Frugalware stuff is so easy to blend to suit my needs.</dd>
    <dt><b>What do you do when you're not working on Frugalware?</b></dt>
    <dd>I have a family of two sons and one :) wife; we like going out. I play football with my friends every week, but if I had to pick my most favourite "sport", I would choose geocaching. I cannot live without reading as well, and it does not matter what I read: from Star Wars novels to some 19th century Hungarian writers, from Harry Potter in English to ingredients of the washing powder... I like taking photographs, too - I am running kind of a photoblog at <a href="http://csecsy.hu">http://csecsy.hu</a> (in Hungarian).</dd>
    <dt><b>What's the view from your front door?</b></dt>
        <dd>As I live in a block house it would not tell you anything, so I have attached a shot made from the balcony instead. Those flowers are only a week old. ;)  Step out on the balcony and <a href="http://frugalware.org/images/interviews/boobaa.jpg">have a look.</a>

    <li>
        <h3>Where is that package? - submitted by 'phayz'</h3>
        <p>If you're looking for a package to meet a specific need, try searching for it via the 'Package search' function on the Frugalware web site.  For example, if you're looking for a PDF viewer, you might be best to enter "pdf" in the description field.</p>
    </li>

    <p>This section relies on your contributions! If have some tips and tricks that you would like to be shown in the newsletter, <b><u><i>please</i></u></b> post them on the forums in the Tips and Tricks section!</p>


<a name="packages"</a>
<h2>Focus On Package(s)</h2>

    <h3>Openbox</h3>
    <p>According to its official web site, "Openbox is a highly configurable, next generation window manager with extensive standards support."  As the description states, Openbox is a window manager, not a desktop environment, and it's important to understand the difference.  It prides itself on being light on resource usage and compliant with the freedesktop standards.  It's a little easier to configure when compared with similar window managers, such as IceWM, Fluxbox etc because a GUI configuration tool, also a menu configuration tool are available.  Another interesting feature is that it can fit easily into desktop environments - Gnome, KDE, XFCE - as a replacement for the native window manager.  With this option you have the best of both worlds.  The documentation on the Openbox web site is very good, explaining how to tweak it for maximum productivity.  Why not try it and see for yourself if it suits you.  Be sure you have enough disk space though, because the Frugalware package requires an enourmous 1.25 Mb disk space when installed.  :)</p>

<h2>Security announcements</h2>
<p>
    <b>Remember</b> - According to the normal support arrangements for Frugalware, the release of 0.8 ("Kalgan") means that support for the previous release has ended.  This means that no further security or bug fixes will be released for Frugalware 0.7 ("Sayshell").
