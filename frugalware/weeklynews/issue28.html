<p>
    Here's a selection of events which have occurred since the previous newsletter:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <h3>Frugalware 0.9 pre2 released</h3>
        <p>On 8 July 2008, VMiklos announced the release of Frugalware 0.9pre2 (Solaria).  This pre-release has some exciting changes and new packages - including Firefox 3.0 and enhancements to FUN (Frugalware Update Notifier).  For full details, read VMiklos' <a href="http://www.frugalware.org/news/103">announcement</a>.  If you can spare the time and bandwidth required, please test this pre-release.  As has been mentioned before, the more bugs found now, the fewer there will be in the final release.</p>

        <h3>Wine is 1(.0) Happy birthday! :)</h3>
        <p>On 17 June 2008, the Wine project recently celebrated its 1.0 release.  For those that don't already know, Wine provides a compatibility layer for Windows applications, allowing some to run successfully on Linux.  This release is a major milestone for the project since it's been in development for 15 years!  Since then, versions 1.1.0 and 1.1.1 have been released.  Version 1.0 is in the Frugalware current repository.</p>

        <h3>The "artist" formerly known as jedifox</h3>
        <p>jedifox recently changed his nickname to "gholafox".  Under his new nickname, his work on packaging continues.  Although he's not (yet) a Frugalware developer, he's contributed a number of Frugalbuilds.  Some of his most recent work has been on packaging games, meaning we can all spend even more time playing games.  If you "see" gholafox on IRC, say "hola".</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h3>Bugs table now has links for all categories</h3>
        <p>In this issue I have updated the Bugs table so that each number is a link to the full details of each category of bugs or requested features.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h3>Errata</h3>
        <p>It seems impossible but there's a bug in editions of the newsletter earlier than 27.  In the Bugs section was a link that was supposed to list all bugs which had been closed since the previous newsletter.  In fact this was a list of both bugs <b>and</b> feature requests.    Since this section has been reformatted entirely, this bug no longer exists.</p>
    </li>
</ul>


<a name="tips"><h2>Tips and tricks</h2></a>

    <b>Disclaimer</b> - Be aware that the hints &amp; tips provided here have NOT been tested and so come with no warranty.
<ul>
    <li>
        <h3>Which packages are installed? - submitted by 'phayz'</h3>
        <p>Over time packages are installed, upgraded and deleted.  Remembering all the packages you have installed at a point in time is impossible.  If you're doing a fresh installation of Frugalware, how do you know just what needs to be reinstalled?  The answer is to regularly run "pacman-g2 -Qi" and save the output: on a USB key, in an email message etc.  You can then refer to this list if you need to reinstall the very same packages.</p>
   </li>
</ul>
    <p>This section relies on your contributions! If have some tips and tricks that you would like to be shown in the newsletter, <b><u><i>please</i></u></b> post them on the forums.</p>


<a name="packages"><h2>Focus On Package(s)</h2></a>

    <h3>AsciiDoc</h3>
    <p>"AsciiDoc is a text document format for writing short documents, articles, books and UNIX man pages. AsciiDoc files can be translated to HTML and DocBook markups using the asciidoc(1) command."  This may not seem very exciting but ASCIIDOC is a great application.  It greatly simplifies the task of writing documentation intended for publishing in many forms.  From the DocBook-formatted output "can be post-processed to presentation formats such as HTML, PDF, DVI, LaTeX, roff, and Postscript using readily available Open Source tools.".  All this starts from a text file which has been marked up in ASCIIDOC-specific markup language.  Frugalware's documentation is maintained in ASCIIDOC format because of all the benefits it brings.</p>


<a name="fixes"><h2>Bug fixes</h2></a>

    <p>The following table gives you a overview of activity on bugs and feature requests as at 19 July 2008.  In each cell of the table is a link to a detailed list of the relevant bugs or feature requests.</p>

<a name="security"><h2>Security announcements</h2></a>

    <p><b>Remember</b> - According to the normal support arrangements for Frugalware, the release of 0.8 ("Kalgan") means that support for the previous release has ended.  This means that no further security or bug fixes will be released for Frugalware 0.7 ("Sayshell").</p>

    <p>Here is a list of <a href="/security">security issues</a> which have been discovered and fixed in the 0.8 release since the previous newsletter.</p>
