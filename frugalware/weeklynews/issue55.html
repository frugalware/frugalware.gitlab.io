  <h2>Frugalware Linux Newsletter - Issue 55</h2>

  <h2>...to inform...to educate...to entertain</h2>

  <p>"Sometimes I think the surest sign that intelligent
  life exists elsewhere in the universe is that none of it has tried to contact
  us."&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>Calvin, from the popular American comic
  series "Calvin and Hobbes".</em></p>

  <h2>Welcome</h2>

  <p>The newsletter's aim is to keep you up to date with what's happened
  recently in the world of the Linux distribution 'Frugalware'.</p>

  <p>Features of this issue include:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>The wiki is back!</li>

    <li>Happy birthday to Devil505</li>

    <li>FLOSS developers are people too</li>

    <li>Let's all go to Monaco</li>

    <li>Getting to know you - Dependencies</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Events</h2>

  <p>Here's a selection of events which have occurred since the previous
  newsletter:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <h3>Gimmix is upgraded</h3>

      <p>Priyank recently packaged a newer version of Gimmix, a GTK-based MPD
      client. It's light on resources but has a great range of features. Gimmix
      is rather special because Priyank is its developer as well as the
      maintainer of its package. After all, who knows a baby better than its
      father or mother? If you want a GUI MPD client, please try it.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <h3>The wiki is back!</h3>

      <p>As I reported in newsletter issue 53, the Frugalware wiki
      unfortunately went offline weeks ago. The original wiki was lost, but
      it's contents had been backed up by VMiklos. To restore the wiki required
      a new installation, review of content and copying all content into the
      new wiki, all done by VMiklos, Bouleetbil and Devil505. Many thanks to
      them for their work. When I last checked, the wiki had a total 1,025
      pages from 12 contributors.</p>

      <p>The <a href="http://wiki.frugalware.org/">Frugalware wiki</a> - also
      known as "FrugalWiki" - is based on MediaWiki, the wiki platform used by
      the famous Wikipedia, as well as other sites. Frugalware is used by
      people from many countries - and we're proud of that - and this means we
      need a multi-language wiki. MediaWiki doesn't allow wiki pages with the
      same titles, so how can we have pages on the same topic in different
      languages? Our answer is to include a reference to the language in the
      title page. For details of this and other rules for editing the wiki,
      please refer to the <a href=
      "http://wiki.frugalware.org/index.php/FrugalWiki_Tutorial_(English)">FrugalWiki
      tutorial</a>.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <h3>Happy birthday to Devil505</h3>

      <p>Devil505 recently celebrated his 2nd birthday. "What!?", I hear you
      say. "Do we really have a developer who is 2 years old? The answer is,
      "Yes" and "No". I'm quite certain Devil505 is not 2 years old in real
      life, although I don't know his real age. I do know that 2 years ago, he
      was accepted into the Frugalware developer team. He's made a great
      contribution to Frugalware over that time, helping not only by packaging
      applications (mostly <em>games</em>), but also community activities, such
      as the wiki and the artwork team. Congratulations, Devil505, and we look
      forward to a lifetime of Frugalware-ing. That's right - one you're "in",
      you're in for life!</p>

      <p>To all other developers, I apologise. I promise I'll find out your
      Frugalware birthday, mark it on the calendar, and mention it in the
      newsletter.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <h3>What difference does two characters make?</h3>

      <p>If you subscribe to the #frugalware group's messages on Identi.ca, you
      will often have seen URLs which have been shortened by the bit.ly
      service. Like other URL shortening services, it takes a "normal" URL and
      converts this into a short URL. When you click on the shortened version,
      bit.ly redirects your web browser to the full URL. These services exist
      for at least two reasons: (1) it's easier to communicate a short URL, and
      (2) it's easier to fit a short URL into the 140-character limit of web
      services like identi.ca and Twitter. In an interesting move, bit.ly now
      has a new name - j.mp. Both services will remain active, but the j.mp
      domain name is to eventually replace the bit.ly domain name. If I
      understand correctly, the change of domain name was made so that URLs
      were shortened by 2 characters. I can understand the change, but wow -
      just two characters? I don't know when or if we will switch to the j.mp
      domain name. Keep watching, though.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <h3>Could all big games please put their hand up?</h3>

      <p>After a discussion amongst the Frugalware developers, it has been
      decided that all games which are bigger than 100 MB will no longer be
      available directly from the repository. Instead they will be "nobuild"
      packages, which means that they will be installed using 'repoman' instead
      of pacman-g2. There were several reasons for this change, the major ones
      being:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>reducing the amount of disk space required by each release - on the
        release ISOs and the build servers;</li>

        <li>reducing the amount of time taken in checking daily the integrity
        of the packages' files.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Getting To Know You</h2>

  <h3>Dependencies</h3>

  <p>Everyone has dependencies - food, sleep, caffeine. Frugalware's packages
  also have dependencies, although caffeine isn't one of them, thankfully.
  Applications written to the GTK toolkit are dependent upon it. Applications
  written to the Qt toolkit are dependent upon it. Each package's dependencies
  are detailed in its FrugalBuild and can be either build or runtime
  dependencies. You might have looked at a package's dependency list, found
  just one package listed, then wondered why many packages were installed when
  you issued the command "pacman -S [package_name]". It was because the
  package's dependencies also had dependencies and so these also had to be
  installed.</p>

  <p>You might have heard of the term "dependency hell". This is a problem
  where you can't install both packages A and B because they have conflicting
  dependencies. Frugalware does its best to avoid the chance of this occurring
  because a package cannot be built if its dependencies can't be met. The
  reverse of dependencies are those cases where packages may conflict and so
  can't co-exist. Again such conflicts are detailed in the package's
  FrugalBuild and pacman-g2 won't allow a package to be installed if it
  conflicts with another. A variation of package conflict is where a package
  replaces another one. The official NVidia driver packages, for example,
  contain their own GL libraries and so replace the functionality of the LIBGLX
  and LIBGL packages. When you install one of the nvidia driver packages, you
  are told about this and asked if you want to continue. If you answer "Yes",
  pacman-g2 will install the NVidia package and remove the other packages,
  avoiding any conflict been libraries that have the same functionality.</p>

  <p>pacman-g2 is very intelligent, but this "intelligence" is based on
  information contained in each package's FrugalBuild. Therefore pacman-g2 can
  never be <strong>more</strong> intelligent than the developers. That's a good
  thing when you think about it, because otherwise we could be in a situation
  like that of Dave in "2001: A Space Odyssey":</p>
  <pre>
        User: pacman-g2 -S tetris
        pacman-g2: I'm sorry, Dave, but I can't do that. You shouldn't be playing games.
</pre>

  <h2>FLOSS developers are people too</h2>

  <p>Without developers, we wouldn't have the Linux kernel and all the software
  that we run on the platform. What motivates FLOSS developers? Why does anyone
  choose to spend their time writing software when they don't get paid to do
  so? What do developers do when they're not writing software? These questions
  and more are the inspiration behind this new section of the newsletter.</p>

  <p>In interviews with FLOSS developers, we get to know them a little better
  as people, and what motivates them in their quest for better software. I'm
  very excited by this new series because I admire their work very much. I'm
  also very grateful to them for taking the time to reply to my requests.</p>

  <p>Interviews in the next few issues will feature:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>The developer of Code Browser;</li>

    <li>Jeff Bailes - developer of Whaaw! Media Player;</li>

    <li>Ali Abdallah - Xfce developer &amp; Parole developer;</li>

    <li>Jesse van den Kieboom - gedit developer.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>This issue, we have an interview with Michael Cornelius - developer of
  fotoxx, UKopp, picpuz and much more. I think Michael has a very interesting
  story to tell and I hope you enjoy reading it. As a native English-language
  speaker, I can honestly say that the quality of Michael's writing is better
  than mine. I wonder if I could persuade him to write for the newsletter?
  :)</p>

  <dl>
    <dt><strong>What's your name?</strong></dt>

    <dd>
      <p>Michael Cornelison. I am a retired American living in Germany with a
      German wife.</p>
    </dd>

    <dt><strong>What FLOSS projects are you involved in?</strong></dt>

    <dd>
      <p>I write code only for the projects on my web site. I contribute bug
      reports to other projects, esp. Ubuntu and Gnome. I sometimes write in
      web forums, but this is minor.</p>
    </dd>

    <dt><strong>What led to you being a FLOSS
    developer/contributor?</strong></dt>

    <dd>
      <p>I became aware of the FLOSS movement in 2006 and got interested. "The
      Cathedral and the Bazaar" was influential. Before that I had written
      software for Windows and DEC VAX (now HP) mainframes. The low ethics of
      Microsoft has long been a problem for me. I wanted a low-cost and open
      development environment for myself, and I wanted something to keep me
      busy and productive during my retirement. I am now 66.</p>
    </dd>

    <dt><strong>What do you like about being a FLOSS
    developer/contributor?</strong></dt>

    <dd>
      <p>The openness, freedom, collaborative nature, abundance of people who
      are ready to help and contribute. I like the mission: provide free and
      open software for the world to use and benefit from.</p>
    </dd>

    <dt><strong>What don't you like about being a FLOSS
    developer/contributor?</strong></dt>

    <dd>
      <p>I recently wrote an essay summarizing my opinions on Linux and the
      FLOSS movement, "Enduring Roadblocks to Linux Acceptance". It was
      published a few weeks ago in Linux Forums: <a href=
      "http://www.linuxforums.org/articles/enduring-roadblocks-to-linux-acceptance_417.html">
      http://www.linuxforums.org/articles/enduring-roadblocks-to-linux-acceptance_417.html</a></p>

      <p>It is also on my web site: <a href=
      "http://kornelix.squarespace.com/linux-opinion/">http://kornelix.squarespace.com/linux-opinion/</a>.</p>

      <p>Please read the essay (3 minutes). In short: I dislike the chaos, lack
      of standards, lack of planning, redundant/competing technologies, the
      sometimes poor quality of code and documentation. I did not mention
      another factor in the above essay: the elitism and condescending attitude
      of some FLOSS heavyweights. When I was starting out and trying to find my
      way in web forums, I got put down for being an ignorant newbie. This
      problem seems to be diminishing over time (are the heavyweights becoming
      less elitist?).</p>
    </dd>

    <dt><strong>What motivates you to work on your projects?</strong></dt>

    <dd>
      <p>Technical interest and a desire to provide useful tools for
      others.</p>
    </dd>

    <dt><strong>What do you do outside the FLOSS world?</strong></dt>

    <dd>
      <p>Since retiring, my wife and I have done extensive traveling and I have
      focused on photography. Other than that, it is a fairly normal life of
      socializing with friends, reading, watching films, etc. I help others
      with computer problems, both Windows and Linux. I have persuaded a few
      friends to convert to Linux - their main concern being malware and the
      lack of security with Windows.</p>
    </dd>

    <dt><strong>What operating system(s) do you use and why?</strong></dt>

    <dd>
      <p>I use only Linux. I keep Windows up to date in order to stay current
      and be able to help others.</p>
    </dd>

    <dt><strong>If people are interested in helping your project(s), how might
    they do this?</strong></dt>

    <dd>
      <p>My e-mail address is published on my web site and in the user guides
      that come with my programs. I encourage others to pass on their bug
      reports or ideas for improvement. I have gotten many ideas this way. I
      have also gotten several GUI translations for fotoxx and some other
      programs from complete strangers. The user guide for fotoxx has only been
      translated into French, and that has not been kept up to date. It is
      large and would require several days of work to translate, so it is
      understandable that no one volunteers. Unfortunately, the technical
      computer world is not very open for those without good English.</p>

  <h2>Tips and tricks</h2>

  <p><b>Disclaimer</b> - Be aware that the hints &amp; tips provided here have
  NOT been tested and so come with no warranty.</p>

  <h3>Keyboard or mouse?</h3>

  <p>The combination of keyboard and mouse as input for PCs is not very
  efficient, but it's the best we have at the moment. You can often improve
  your efficiency if you learn the keyboard shortcuts of your favourite
  applications. Many applications have cheat sheets available, which are
  one-page handy references of features and functions, including keyboard
  shortcuts. If you keep one of these near your PC, it makes the task of
  learning a little easier.</p>

  <h3>What's your status? (in 140 characters or less)</h3>

  <p>Microblogging services like Twitter and identi.ca are a great way of
  getting a brief message to one person, or many people. It's most often used
  for communicating personal messages, but it's also an excellent way of
  sending non-personal messages, such as the status of services. For example,
  you might set up automated monitoring which tells subscribers of a server's
  status changes. People who want to receive these messages subscribe (or
  "listen") to the group. Using a method like this, you don't have to maintain
  a list of people to be notified of messages, which could quickly be out of
  date. Of course the microblogging service identi.ca is recommended over
  Twitter because identi.ca is licensed under the <a href=
  "http://www.fsf.org/licensing/licenses/agpl-3.0.html">GNU Affero General
  Public License (AGPL)</a>.</p>

  <p>This section relies on your contributions! If have some tips and tricks
  that you would like to be shown in the newsletter, <em>please</em> post them
  on the forums.</p>

  <h2>Focus On Package(s)</h2>

  <h3>Everyone... start your engines...3...2...1...go!</h3>

  <p>In keeping with his unofficial title as "The Games Master", Frugalware
  developer Devil505 has added a new game to the current repository. "<a href=
  "http://vdrift.net/">VDrift</a> is a cross-platform, open source driving
  simulation made with drift racing in mind.</p>

  <p>"This game is in the early stages of development but is already very
  playable. Currently the game features:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Over 20 tracks, almost 30 cars;</li>

    <li>Simple networked multi-player mode (currently disabled, waiting to be
    rewritten);</li>

    <li>Very realistic physics;</li>

    <li>Mouse/joystick/gamepad/wheel/keyboard support;</li>

    <li>Fully modeled tracks, scenery and terrain;</li>

    <li>Several different camera modes".</li>
  </ul>

  <p>If you have ever felt the need... the need for speed, then you should try
  VDrift.</p><a href=
  "http://frugalware.org/images/newsletter/issue55_vdrift_screenshot.jpg"><img src="http://frugalware.org/images/newsletter/issue55_vdrift_screenshot_t.jpg"
  alt="Screenshot of VDrift"></a>

  <h3>Let's all go to Monaco</h3>

  <p>Frugalware contributor Laszlo Papp recently submitted a FrugalBuild for a
  monospace font named Monaco. It's commonly used on the Mac platform as the
  default monospace font, but it fits just as well on Linux. It's a little
  different to most monospace fonts because it has serifs. If you're not quite
  happy with your current monospace font, please try Monaco. Visiting the city
  of the same name might be more fun, but you would probably just lose a lot of
  money.</p>

  <h3>The Widget Factory</h3>

  <p>For anyone who, like me, loves to try out GTK themes, <a href=
  "http://www.stellingwerff.com/?page_id=10">The Widget Factory</a> is
  something you should have installed. It's a simple GTK-based application
  which consists of all the available GTK components. Via the menu you can
  select an installed GTK theme and The Widget Factory then has the selected
  theme applied. It's only purpose is to allow you to preview GTK themes.</p>
