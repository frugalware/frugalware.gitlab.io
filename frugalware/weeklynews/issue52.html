  <h2>Frugalware Linux Newsletter - Issue 52</h2>

  <h2>...to inform...to educate...to entertain</h2>

  <p>When NASA first started sending up astronauts, they discovered that pens would not work in zero gravity. To combat this problem, NASA scientists spent a decade and $12 million developing the ball point pen that writes in zero gravity, upside down, underwater, on almost any surface including glass and at temperatures ranging from below freezing to over 300C.</p>

  <p>When confronted with the same problem, the Russians used a pencil.</p>

  <h2>Welcome</h2>

  <p>The newsletter's aim is to keep you up to date with what's happened
  recently in the world of the Linux distribution 'Frugalware'.</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Gnome 2.28 is now available</li>

    <li>Frugalware's users are people too - DeX77</li>

    <li>Tips and tricks - "Seeing is believing"</li>

    <li>Focus On Package(s) - Celestia and UKopp</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Events etc</h2>

  <p>Here's a selection of events which have occurred since the previous
  newsletter:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <h3>An ego the size of a whale!</h3>

      <p>I have had thousands of email messages from newsletter readers asking
      why, at the end of each newsletter, I remind everyone that it is I who
      writes the newsletter. Is it because I have an ego the size of a whale?
      Believe it or not, I don't do it because I want to take all the credit.
      Instead I want remind everyone that any errors in the newsletter are
      entirely <em>my</em> fault and not of the developers or other
      contributors.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <h3>Gnome 2.28 is now available</h3>

      <p>Gnome 2.28 was recently released and the development team has already
      packaged it and it's now available from the "current" repository. There
      have been many changes since the previous release, and there are a lot of
      dependencies, so it is a difficult, time-consuming job to package it all.
      Many thanks for Bouleetbil and others in the development team for their
      hard work.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <h3>Don't cry for me, Argentina</h3>

      <p>OK - in fact wherever you live, don't cry for Anacreon, Frugalware
      release 1.0. After all, we have a new stable release in Getorin,
      Frugalware release 1.1. Anacreon was a good, reliable friend but when a
      more current model, with even more features comes along, it's hard not to
      resist. If you're still running release 1.0, please consider upgrading.
      Anacreon will understand and anyway, all Frugalware releases have a
      special place in our hearts.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <h3>"Quick Draw" Devil505</h3>

      <p>If Devil505 had been a gunfighter in America's Wild West, I would
      never have challenged him to a gun fight. A Frugalware user recently
      submitted a bug report for a package named 'wifi-radar'. According to my
      mail client, this bug was reported at 6:53 pm and Devil505 submitted a
      patch to fix this bug at 7:36 pm. That's what I call quick! Of course not
      all bugs get fixed this quickly, but it's good when it does happen.</p>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Frugalware's users are people too</h2>

  <p>This is the latest in a series of interviews with Frugalware users, in
  which we get to know a little about the person. Please read on...</p>

  <dl>
    <dt><strong>What's your name?</strong></dt>

    <dd>
      <p>Daniel Exner</p>
    </dd>

    <dt><strong>What's your IRC/forum nickname?</strong></dt>

    <dd>
      <p>DeX, or DeX77. I'm not 32 but 28, the 77 is just because someone
      already used 66 :)</p>
    </dd>

    <dt><strong>In what country do you live?</strong></dt>

    <dd>
      <p>Germany</p>
    </dd>

    <dt><strong>In what country were you born?</strong></dt>

    <dd>
      <p>Germany</p>
    </dd>

    <dt><strong>What operating system(s) did you use before FW ?</strong></dt>

    <dd>
      <p>To my shame I have to admit that I used all DOS and Windows versions
      up to Windows 2000. But then I switched to Slackware :)</p>
    </dd>

    <dt><strong>When did you start to use Linux (Frugalware)?</strong></dt>

    <dd>
      <p>head /var/log/pacman-g2.log = [12/19/06 17:56] I guess that's roughly
      the moment I started to use it :)</p>
    </dd>

    <dt><strong>What do you like most about Frugalware?</strong></dt>

    <dd>
      <p>What I like most about Frugalware is the transparency of the build
      process: most distros provide the tools to create your own packages, and
      some have even large package provider communities. But none I have found
      so far that have such a well-documented package building process. What I
      also like is the policy to provide as minimal patches as possible. That
      really ties Frugalware close to upstream and I think both sides benefit
      from that.</p>
    </dd>

    <dt><strong>What would you like to see changed in Frugalware?</strong></dt>

    <dd>
      <p>I would like to see more devs! It's a pity to see the weight of
      maintaining all those packages distributed amongst such a small bunch of
      people. Although I must admit they do a really good job :)</p>
    </dd>

    <dt><strong>Do you do something active in order to spread the knowledge of
    Frugalware?</strong></dt>

    <dd>
      <p>Sure, I flame about (X|K)ubuntu as much as I can. :) No, just kidding.
      I try to convince people around me, to at least try the Frugal way and at
      least some of them now are happy Frugal users.</p>
    </dd>

    <dt><strong>For what purpose(s) do you use Frugalware?</strong></dt>

    <dd>
      <p>Given I'm in the IT business I mostly do development with it. But I
      also use it at home for multimedia, occasional gaming and keeping in
      touch with the world.</p>
    </dd>

    <dt><strong>How did you find Frugalware - e.g. a friend/Google
    search?</strong></dt>

    <dd>
      <p>Some guy on a German Slackware forum was whining about Slackware
      missing more modern software and someone else suggested Frugalware as an
      alternative. As I myself was somewhat frustrated with Slackware at that
      moment I thought: "Why not? Give it a try" :)</p>
    </dd>

    <dt><strong>What do you do when you're not using Frugalware?</strong></dt>

    <dd>
      <p>I'm forced to use Windows ;) I guess you are asking about hobbies with
      that question? Well that would be watching/reading SciFi and Anime/Manga,
      swimming, cycling and when there is still time left at the end of the day
      I remember to do things for my M.Sc. in Computer Science.</p>
    </dd>

    <dt><strong>Please show us a screenshot of your desktop(s)</strong></dt>

    <dd>
      <p><a href=

      "http://frugalware.org/images/interviews/dex77_desktop_t.jpg" alt=
      "DeX77's desktop"></a></p>

      <p>Yeah, that's my girlfriend. No we are not (yet) married :)</p>
    </dd>

    <dt><strong>What's the view from your front door? (please provide a
    photograph, with no people in view)</strong></dt>

    <dd>
      <p><a href=
      "http://frugalware.org/images/interviews/dex77_office.jpg"><img src=
      "http://frugalware.org/images/interviews/dex77_office_t.jpg" alt=
      "View from DeX77's office"></a></p>

      <p>That's not a view from my front door but from my
      office. I guess that's more impressive :)</p>

  <h2>Getting To Know You</h2>

  <p>In this section of the newsletter, we get to know Frugalware Linux a
  little at a time. This is not meant to replace the official documentation but
  instead make it easier to read. This should suit those those people who, like
  me, have short attention spans. :)</p>

  <h3>It's Release Time!</h3>

  <p>We recently had Frugalware 1.1 released, so now is a good time to talk
  about the release process. Releases occur six months apart, usually in April
  and September. Scheduling releases according to time means that everyone
  involved can schedule their work to suit. If a new release of Gnome occurs
  shortly before the release date for example, the decision to stay with the
  Gnome release already in the repositories is easier to make. Making these
  types of decisions based on other criteria is generally much more difficult,
  because everyone has different ideas as to when things are ready for
  <em>release</em>.</p>

  <p>Before the final release, several test releases are made - two release
  candidates and one pre-release. These test the release infrastructure and are
  an opportunity for everyone to see what the final release will look like and
  provide feedback. A few days before each release there is a "freeze", when
  only bug fixes are allowed. Between each test release, most effort goes into
  fixing reported bugs and making any changes that are required before the
  final release, but package updates also continue.</p>

  <h2>New Packages</h2>

  <p>In this new section of the newsletter I'll highlight some packages which
  have been added since the previous issue.</p>

  <table border="1" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0">

  <h2>Tips and tricks</h2>

  <p><b>Disclaimer</b> - Be aware that the hints &amp; tips provided here have
  NOT been tested and so come with no warranty.</p>

  <p>This section relies on your contributions! If you have some tips and
  tricks that you would like to be shown in the newsletter, <em>please</em>
  post them on the forums.</p>

  <h3>To do, or not to do...</h3>

  <p>Most of us do not have enough time in which to do all the things we want
  to do. You might want to achieve world peace or marry Halle Berry. In fact
  marrying Halle Berry shouldn't be one of <em>your</em> goals because it's one
  of <em>my</em> goals, but that's not really relevant to my point. Maintaining
  a "To Do" list is one tool which can help you be more productive because
  it:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>helps you keep focused on your goals;</li>

    <li>allows you to prioritise your goals;</li>

    <li>can be shared with others, who may be able to help you achieve a
    specific goal.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>It really doesn't matter how you maintain your list, whether it's on a
  piece of paper, in a notebook, or using any one of numerous 'To Do'
  applications or web sites available. If you don't have enough items to put on
  your "To Do" list, contact VMiklos because apparently he has
  <strong>LOTS</strong> that he would like to share. :)</p>

  <h3>"Seeing is believing"</h3>

  <p>This is an English-language proverb which means that when you see
  something with your own eyes, you believe it's really happening. In the case
  of screencasts, seeing can also help you understand something better. Some
  people - including myself - find it's easier to understand something if it's
  demonstrated. Screencasts are (usually) brief videos with audio commentary,
  the aim of which is to teach you something. They can be produced on almost
  any PC and hosted for free on web sites such as YouTube and Vimeo. A search
  on a technical topic you're interested in, combined with the word
  "screencast", will usually return at least a few hits. Screencasts have an
  advantage over written documentation because, even if you don't understand
  the language of the audio track, you should still be able to understand
  what's being shown. If you have never looked at a screencast, search the
  Internet for topics that interest you because you'll probably be surprised at
  what you find.</p>

  <p>As a starting point, here are links to some popular screencasting web
  sites:</p>

  <div style="margin-left: 2em">
    <div style="margin-left: 2em">
      <a href="http://showmedo.com">ShowMeDo</a> - videos about FLOSS software
      and programming;
    </div>

    <div style="margin-left: 2em">
      <a href=
      "http://screencasters.heathenx.org/">Screencasters.heathenx.org</a> -
      "Inkscape tutorials for the novice artist"
    </div>
  </div>

  <h2>Focus On Package(s)</h2>

  <h3>Celestia</h3>

  <p>At some point in their life, everyone has gazed up at the night sky, awed
  by the seemingly limitless void that is known as "space". This often inspires
  meaningful questions, such as:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Is there intelligent life on other planets?;</li>

    <li>What would it be like to travel to the stars and other planets?;</li>

    <li>What might aliens look like and would they be friendly?;</li>

    <li>Would humans live in peace if we lived on other planets?;</li>

    <li>Where did I put my house keys?</li>
  </ul>

  <p><a href="http://www.shatters.net/celestia/">Celestia</a> is a space
  simulator which allows you to navigate through the universe with a
  first-person view. As described on the Celestia home page, "Unlike most
  planetarium software, Celestia doesn't confine you to the surface of the
  Earth. You can travel throughout the solar system, to any of over 100,000
  stars, or even beyond the galaxy. All movement in Celestia is seamless; the
  exponential zoom feature lets you explore space across a huge range of
  scales, from galaxy clusters down to spacecraft only a few meters across. A
  'point-and-goto' interface makes it simple to navigate through the universe
  to the object you want to visit. Celestia is expandable. Celestia comes with
  a large catalog of stars, galaxies, planets, moons, asteroids, comets, and
  spacecraft. If that's not enough, you can download dozens of easy to install
  add-ons with more objects."</p>

  <p>Anyone who has dreamed of traveling in space, or has an interest in
  astronomy, should try out Celestia. You too can have the opportunity of
  "Going where no man (or woman) has gone before."</p>

  <h3>UKopp</h3>

  <p><a href="http://kornelix.squarespace.com/ukopp/">UKopp</a> is a simple,
  easy-to-use GUI application for backing up files and folders to a USB stick
  or similar media. You can set up jobs, which are sets of pre-defined
  configuration items, including source and destination folders, files to
  include and exclude etc. Each time a backup is run, only files and folders
  which have been modified since the previous backup are copied. You have the
  option of keeping old versions of files, allowing you to restore older
  versions instead of only the previous version. For advanced users of
  Frugalware, there may be better backup options, but the beauty of UKopp is
  simplicity and ease of use. It's ideal for people are need an easy, reliable
  backup method. If you have any friends or family who use Linux, why not
  introduce them to UKopp? It may be the best thing you've done for yourself!
