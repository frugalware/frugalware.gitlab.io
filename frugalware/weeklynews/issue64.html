  <p>Here's a selection of events which have occurred since the previous
  newsletter:</p>

  <h3>Artwork for Frugalware 1.3 progresses</h3>

  <p>As I mentioned in the previous newsletter issue, artwork for Frugalware
  1.3, code-name "Haven", is progressing. Artwork coordinator Devil505 recently
  conducted a poll on his <a href=
  "http://frugalware.org/~devil505/blog/">blog</a> to choose the default icon
  theme and the winner was MeliaeSVG. He has also chosen the default GTK+2 and
  Metacity themes - Toidi and X-Lite colors respectively.</p>

  <p>New wallpapers are also being submitted by artists for consideration. You
  can view them in the wiki page for 1.3's artwork, located <a href=
  "http://wiki.frugalware.org/index.php/Artwork_1.3">here</a>. Thanks to
  everyone who has already contributed. It's exciting to see the new look for
  Haven slowly taking shape. Don't forget it's not too late to get involved.
  Submit your ideas and artwork via the wiki, or send an email to Devil505.</p>

  <h3>Farewell to the Rox desktop *sob*</h3>

  <p>In April 2010, Frugalware developer ryuo asked Frugalware's users to vote
  on whether or not the ROX desktop should remain. He only received one reply -
  from me - saying I thought they should not remain. Since no-one said they
  should stay, they were deleted from Frugalware. A few of the ROX packages
  still remain - ROX Filer and roxterm - because they can be used without the
  ROX desktop itself.</p>

  <h3>Sorry I'm late, Francois</h3>

  <p>Since about mid-2008, Francios Biot has submitted many FrugalBuilds for
  packages which are new to Frugalware. Unfortunately I have never thanked him
  here in the newsletter and for that I apologise. His name appears below in
  the list of new packages, because he contributed the FrugalBuild for
  open-vcdiff.</p>

  <h2><img src="http://frugalware.org/images/newsletter/package.png" align=

  <p>In this new section of the newsletter I'll highlight some new packages

  <h2><img src="http://frugalware.org/images/newsletter/tip.png" align=
  "left">Tips and tricks</h2>

  <p><b>Disclaimer</b> - Be aware that the hints &amp; tips provided here have
  NOT been tested and so come with no warranty.</p>

  <h3>pacman-g2's "upgradedelay" parameter</h3>

  <p>Those that use the 'current' repository are a little brave, because
  problems do sometimes occur if you keep up with the very latest packages. Any
  problems which do occur are fixed by the development team as soon as possible
  but until then you may be left with broken packages. To reduce the chance of
  this happening, pacman-g2 has a useful option - "upgradedelay". This option
  instructs pacman-g2 to install only packages which are a minimum 'X' days
  old. This delay between a package's release and when you install it gives you
  a good chance of avoiding problem packages. Refer to pacman-g2's man page for
  further details.</p>

  <h3>Plug it in before you sync</h3>

  <p>In newsletter issue 57 I explained that you can keep pacman-g2's package
  cache directory on writable, removable media, so that you can share it
  amongst several Frugalware systems. There is just one thing you need to be
  aware of if you use this method. If you run pacman-g2 without the media
  attached, pacman-g2 will create the directory to which the media would
  normally be mounted, and download packages into it. When you next connected
  the removable media, it would be mounted to a directory with the same name,
  but with an underscore ("_") appended to the name. Any packages already on
  the removable media would be ignored by pacman-g2 because it's configured to
  look in a different directory for its packages. The tip here, then is: if
  you're going to use this tip, always connect the removable media before
  running pacman-g2.</p>

  <h3>Tell everyone about Frugalware</h3>

  <p>Promoting Frugalware can be quite simple, and doesn't involve a lot of
  effort. For example, you can mention of Frugalware in your email or forum's signature. In one
  online forum I visit often, I have the phrase "Doing his best for Frugalware
  Linux with a text editor and git." in my signature. When people in that forum
  ask about distributions that they might try, I tell them a little about
  Frugalware and my experience with it. I don't try to persuade people that
  they should switch to Frugalware, but if they ask, I want them to know enough
  that they can judge for themselves whether or not it might be "right" for
  them.</p>

  <p>This section relies on your contributions! If you have some tips and
  tricks that you would like to be shown in the newsletter, <em>please</em>
  post them on the forums.</p>

  <h2><img src="http://frugalware.org/images/newsletter/package.png" align=
  "left">Focus On Package(s)</h2>

  <h3>cdw</h3>

  <p>As described in its man page, "<a href=
  "http://cdw.sourceforge.net/">cdw</a> is a front-end for command-line tools
  used for burning data CD and DVD discs and for related tasks." You can
  achieve the same tasks with the various tools that cdw uses, but your brain
  would probably be scrambled when you were finished. If you work most often at
  the CLI, or simply don't want to use a GUI tool, this is a great choice. It
  has a very simple, easy-to-use interface, allowing you to quickly get the job
  done. Many aspects of its behaviour can be configured, meaning you don't have
  to select the same options each time you run cdw.</p>

  <h3>GNOME Log Viewer</h3>

  <p>Monitoring logs can be difficult, especially for people who are not
  familiar with the command line, because it usually involves the use of CLI
  tools 'grep' and 'tail'. If you're not sure just which log you should be
  monitoring, it gets even more frustrating. The GNOME Log Viewer is a GUI
  utility which allows you to easily view and monitor system logs. The view of
  each log is "live", so as the log file is added to, the new lines appear in
  Log Viewer. You can also filter the view of any log for specific text, which
  is very useful if you know what you're looking for.</p>

  <p>Next time you need to review log files, think of GNOME Log Viewer. In
  fact, now might be a good time to run it and find out what it contains. It's
  good to know before a problem occurs, what each of the system logs
  contains.</p>
