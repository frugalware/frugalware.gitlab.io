  <p>Here's a selection of recent events and other items that you might find
  interesting:</p>

  <h3>Frugalware release party has been cancelled</h3>

  <p>In newsletter issue 66, it was announced that the Frugalware 1.3 release
  party was to be hosted by Danish translator - beecarl - at his house. Drinks
  and food were all arranged, and all travel arrangements made, with developers
  and contributors traveling by plane, train, car, bus and donkey. It's with
  great sadness then, that we have to announce that the release party has been
  cancelled. Beecarl instead decided to "jump ship" (to use an English-language
  phrase), more accurately, he jumped on a ship. If you don't believe it, please
  read his <a href="http://frugalware.dk/?p=593">blog</a> entry. It's hard to
  believe that he would prefer a free and easy life on the open sea to hosting a
  noisy party for a large number of geeks. Oh well, maybe he'll have returned in
  time for 1.4's release party? Until then we'll just sit here and look out over
  the ocean... </p>


  <h2><img src="http://frugalware.org/images/newsletter/package.png" align="left">New Packages</h2>

  <p>No new packages have been added to Frugalware since the last newsletter
  issue, but that's not because the developers are taking a break. With
  Frugalware release 1.3 - code-name "Haven" - due soon, new packages are not
  allowed. Until 1.3 is released the developers are focused on fixing existing
  bugs. New packages must wait until after 1.3 has been released.</p>


  <h2><img src="http://frugalware.org/images/newsletter/tip.png" align="left">Tips and tricks</h2>

  <p><b>Disclaimer</b> - Be aware that the hints &amp; tips provided here have
  NOT been tested and so come with no warranty.</p>

  <h3>Be bold and try a new font!</h3>

  <p>Geeks are generally known as risk-takers, constantly living life on the
  edge, taking chances and daring to dream. It only makes sense, then, that you
  might like to take this to the extreme and try some new monospace fonts in
  your terminal emulator. There are some excellent monospace TrueType fonts
  available, packaged for Frugalware. Terminus looks like a bitmap font (and the
  bitmap version is available in another package), very square and very easy to
  read, even at quite a small size. It was designed to ease eyestrain over long
  coding sessions. Monaco looks much like the default monospace font on Apple
  PCs. It's more rounded and with some letters having serifs, looks more
  stylish than some other monospace fonts. DejaVu Sans Mono, Droid Sans Mono and
  Liberation Mono look very similar and each are excellent fonts. Any one of
  these could be just the font you're looking for so please - install and try
  them all.</p>

  <h3>Remove orphaned packages</h3>

  <p>Every now and then you should search for a remove orphaned packages. As
  stated in pacman-g2's man page, they "were installed as a dependency (i.e. not
  installed explicitly) and are not required by any other packages". Since
  they're no longer required, they're simply using disk space for no good
  reason. Entering the following command will give you a list of orphaned
  packages, which you can then have pacman-g2 remove.</p>

  <pre>pacman -Qe</pre>

  <p>This section relies on your contributions! If you have some tips and
  tricks that you would like to be shown in the newsletter, <em>please</em>
  post them on the forums.</p>


  <h2><img src="http://frugalware.org/images/newsletter/package.png" align="left">Focus On Package(s)</h2>

  <h3>NetSurf</h3>

  <p><a href="http://www.netsurf-browser.org">NetSurf</a> describes itself as
  "Small as a mouse, fast as a cheetah, and available for free. NetSurf is a
  portable web browser for RISC OS, AmigaOS, BeOS and UNIX-like platforms."
  Unlike several other web browsers, it's not based on either the WebKit or
  Gecko engines, but uses its own engine. This means that it has very few
  dependencies and is not tied to a desktop environment. It is very fast to
  start but has all the major features you would expect from a web browser,
  including proxy support, ability to search from the address bar and content
  blocking. In my experience it has some quirks when rendering various web sites
  but nothing that would cause difficulty. Even if you already have one of the
  major browsers installed, you might like to use NetSurf to load web content on
  demand - e.g. opening links in email messages or messages on identi.ca. </li>

  <h3>gbrainy</h3>

  <p><a href="http://live.gnome.org/gbrainy">gbrainy</a> "is a brain teaser game
  and trainer to have fun and to keep your brain trained" according to its home
  page. These games make a nice change from first-person shooters because they
  challenge your brain power. It has three difficulty settings which is good if
  you find the games too hard or too easy. When you complete each game, or
  decide to quit ( :) ), gbrainy provides you a barchart which shows your
  results over the various types of games and provides tips on how you might
  improve. Pay attention to those tips and soon you might be a gbrainy
  champion.</p>
