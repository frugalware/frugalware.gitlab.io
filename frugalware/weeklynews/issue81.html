  <p>Here’s a selection of recent events and other items that you might find
  interesting:</p>

  <h4>Frugalware release 1.5 rc2 has been released</h4>
  
  <p>On 1 August 2011, developer VMiklos announced the latest in the series 
  of test releases for Frugalware release 1.5 ("Mores"). There have been 
  some significant changes since the previous test release so we need your 
  help. If you have the required time and bandwidth available, <strong>
  please</strong> help test this release for us. All that's required is to 
  install it as you usually would, together with all your usual packages. 
  Don't do this on your main computer but instead on a spare PC or a virtual 
  PC. If you find anything which worked in release 1.4 but now doesn't work, 
  please report these bugs in the <a href="http://bugs.frugalware.org/">Bug 
  Tracking System.</a></p>

  <h4>Bon voyage, Carl</h4>
  
  <p>Frugalware contributor Carl Andersen announced on 4 July 2011 on the 
  i18n mailing list that he will no longer be contributing Danish 
  translations. His other interests and activities, including sailing, are 
  taking priority. Over the past 4 years he has done an excellent job and of 
  course we're sorry to see him leave. Featuring in this issue is a farewell 
  interview with Carl, in which he reflects on his contributions to 
  Frugalware. Good luck and may he have good winds wherever he travels.</p>

  <h4>Welcome back Jercel!</h4>
  
  <p>Just as Carl announced that he was leaving the Frugalware team, Jercel
  announced his return after a break of about 6 months. He's made some
  great contributions in the past so it's great to have him back.</p>
  
  <h4>pacman-g2 is now faster</h4>
  
  <p>VMiklos recently changed the way in which pacman-g2's package database is
  stored and handled. Until then the database, contained in a single file,
  was downloaded and uncompressed to many small files. When searching across
  the database this was very inefficient and slow because many files were
  opened and closed in turn. The change means that the database is downloaded
  and uncompressed in memory instead of on disk, resulting in a fantastic
  increase in performance overall. If pacman-g2 was a commercial product,
  we would probably be advertising it's "New and improved formula!" so get it
  now because you never know, it just might make your clothes cleaner and
  brighter! :P</p>

  <h4>Please submit hardware reviews in the wiki</h4>
  
  <p>Before buying hardware it's great to know if someone else already has 
  it and if they had any problems getting it to work under Linux. Sometimes 
  you can find information and other times you can't. For everyone's' 
  benefit, <strong>please</strong> add to the wiki a little information 
  about the hardware you use, particularly laptops, printers and other 
  peripherals. The wiki entry doesn't have to be long but it should include 
  manufacturer and model and a brief description of your experience with it. 
  If you had to change configuration files please include these or provide a 
  link to the resources you used (external web site, for example) to make 
  these changes. If everyone in the community did this for their hardware we 
  would have an incredibly useful resource, not only for Frugalware users 
  but all Linux users.</p>

  <h4>Don't be afraid of console applications</h4>
  
  <p>Although GUI applications often win fans for their 'bling', console 
  applications usually win fans for their functionality. They have several 
  advantages over equivalent GUI applications:</p>
  
  <ul>
	  <li>they are often faster and require fewer system resources (memory 
	  and CPU), making them especially good for older PCs and PCs/laptops 
	  with less powerful CPUs;</li>
	  
	  <li>text-only interfaces use less screen space compared to a GUI 
	  interface and if you use a small font you can fit a lot onto a screen. 
	  This is especially useful for netbooks;</li>
	  
	  <li>they make a great combination with utilities such as <a 
	  href= "http://www.gnu.org/software/screen/screen.html">screen
	  </a> and <a href="http://www.tenshu.net/terminator/">Terminator
	  </a>.</li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>Here are some console-based applications which you might find useful as 
  a replacement for a GUI application:</p>
  
  <ul>
	  <li>tyrs - Identi.ca and Twitter client;</li>
	  <li>irssi - IRC client;</li>
	  <li>bashburn - Burn content to writeable CD/DVD media;</li>
	  <li>MOC - console audio player.</li>
  </ul>

  <div class="postheader">Interview</div>
  <img class="face" src="/images/newsletter/terminal.png" width="85" height="85" alt=""><br>

  <p>As I mentioned in the "Events etc" section, Carl Andersen will no longer
  be contributing to Frugalware. Before he sailed away into the sunset I
  asked him for a farewell interview, a chance to reflect on his work and
  achievements. Thankfully he agreed and here is what he said...</p>

  <dl>
	  <dt><strong>What motivated you to begin translating Frugalware 
	  projects?</strong></dt>
	  
		<dd>Early on, I became interested in translating Frugalware 
		projects. Mainly because I knew that a lot of Danish consumers were 
		interested in Frugalware's projects. I felt it only natural that 
		these people deserved to be able to read the manuals in their own 
		language. I also knew that there were a lot of elderly people who 
		did not know a word of English. I soon discovered that it was also a 
		lot of fun, as well as very hard work, translating the projects. 
		However, I also felt that it was important to keep going. All this 
		kept me interested and urged me to keep bettering myself.</dd><br />
		
	  <dt><strong>Did you learn anything over the four years you provided 
	  translations?</strong></dt>
	  
		<dd>Yes. I learned a lot of technical terms which came in handy in 
		future projects. I also learned that translation from one language 
		to another is very hard work and that it takes a person with great 
		dedication to keep at it even when things get tough. It made me 
		appreciate other people's hard work even more than I did before, as 
		well as gave me a whole new perspective on words and translation in 
		general. The translation process also did wonders for my vocabulary. 
		Over the course of four years I also came to appreciate the 
		Frugalware organisation more and more, not to mention its 
		developers, whom I have always thought did an excellent job in 
		developing Frugalware.</dd><br />
		
	  <dt><strong>Did you have any aim(s) when you started ? If you did, did 
	  you achieve it/them?</strong></dt>
	  
		<dd>Firstly, when I started translating I wanted to make Frugalware 
		and its projects known to a larger audience within Denmark. I feel 
		that I have fulfilled this aim. I run a website which focuses on 
		Frugalware and in four years it has been visited by 90,000 people 
		worldwide. So I am very pleased. Secondly, I especially wanted 
		elderly people to get acquainted with Frugalware and its projects. I 
		also feel that this aim has been achieved as I have gotten a lot of 
		positive responses to my work from all age groups.</dd><br />
		
	  <dt><strong>Are there any special moments you remember?</strong></dt>
	  
		<dd>There are always a lot of good and bad moments when you 
		embark on a grand adventure. However, I am glad to say that there 
		are a lot more good moments than bad. I especially remember my 
		moment of triumph when I first felt that all my hard work was 
		recognized and I also appreciate all the positive response and 
		heartfelt congratulations I get from people all over the world. I 
		really feel that I have been part of something important.</dd><br />
		
	  <dt><strong>Would you recommend translating to others who might be 
	  interested?</strong></dt>
	  
		<dd>Definitely. I hope other people will take the translation of 
		Frugalware projects as seriously as I have. I feel it necessary to 
		keep the spirit of Frugalware alive and this is why the translation 
		process is such an important part. Without the translators there 
		would not be so many people who would be able to benefit from 
		Frugalware's projects. Of course more and more people nowadays are 
		able to understand English, but I still feel that many people are 
		happy that they are able to read about Frugalware in their own 
		language, especially the package program.</dd><br />
		
	  <dt><strong>Will you remain using Frugalware Linux?</strong></dt>
	  
		<dd>At the moment I am not using Frugalware Linux. I have 
		decided to try something new so at the moment I use Linux Mint. So 
		far I am very pleased with this version. It is very easy to install 
		and I really like the design. I could not be happier. I have used 
		Linux for twelve and a half years and I cannot promise that I will 
		never go back to using Frugalware Linux again. However, at the 
		moment I am happy exploring other possibilities. After all, they do 
		say that new experiences broaden the mind.</dd><br />

  <img class="face" src="/images/newsletter/package-new.png" width="85" height="85" alt=""><br>

  <h4>View Your Mind</h4>

  <p>View Your Mind (VYM) is a mind mapping tool but just what you do with it is 
  not easy to explain. The general idea is that a mind map allows you to 
  record your ideas and thoughts in a graphical format which shows the 
  connections between them. Creating a mind map is done by starting at a 
  central point and branching out from there into related topics and 
  sub-topics. The advantage to this method is that it's easier to understand 
  connections between ideas because they're clearly shown in the map. It 
  requires both the analytical and artistic sides of the brain so is a more 
  effective method of noting ideas compared with a written list or "brain 
  dump". Mind maps, and VYM in this case, can be used for many 
  purposes but common uses are project planning. Look at the VYM home page,
  which itself was created using VYM, for an example of its output. Creating
  a mind map on computer is easier than on paper and more easily shared since
  you can send either the map file itself or export it a static image format.
  Next time you're writing down ideas on a topic, try VYM and you just might
  get better results.</p>

  <div class="postheader">Users' Desktop Screenshots</div>
  <img class="face" src="/images/newsletter/desktop.png" width="85" height="85" alt=""><br>

  <p>This new section of the newsletter features screenshots of users' desktop
  configurations. Whether we use a desktop environment or only a window
  manager, most of us like to tweak the appearance of our desktop until it
  looks just right. With almost endless configuration options it can become an
  obsession. The screenshots which appear in this section are examples of what
  you can achieve. You may not like them all but you may learn about an option
  or application that you didn't know before. If the creator of the screenshot
  has provided details of the configuration, these are provided below.</p>

  <h4>Phayz</h4>

  <p>Sadly there's only one users' desktop screenshot in this issue.
  <em>Please do submit them in the forum, otherwise this feature
  will disappear.</em></p>
  
  <p>This screenshot features the IDE or Ikea Desktop Environment which is 
  very flexible, allowing for personal customisation. Highlights of this
  desktop include:</p>
  
  <ul>
	  <li>1. A device commonly called a telephone which allows 
	  people to communicate verbally to each other. Although it's 
	  considered outdated now, prior to the rise of social networks 
	  it was the primary means of communication worldwide;</li>
	  
	  <li> 2. A drinks container, allowing the convenient storage of 
	  beverages such as tea or coffee. These are commonly used to keep the 
	  user awake;</li>
	  
	  <li>3. A notepad and pencil. These are even rarer than the telephone 
	  and were once a common means of noting information. These are 
	  considered of historic value only and have since been replaced with 
	  smart phones and tablets;</li>
	  
	  <li>4. A maze of cables which clearly illustrates the value of 
	  wireless devices. In fact this arrangement is kept only to encourage 
	  others to prevent this happening in their own homes.</li>
  </ul>

  <div class="postheader">From the wiki to you...</div>
  <img class="face" src="/images/newsletter/wiki.png" width="85" height="85" /><br />

  <p>The wiki is a very useful source of information about Frugalware, 
  hardware and applications. Sometimes the question is asked: what should go 
  in the wiki and what should go in the official manual? The general 
  guideline is that the manual's purpose is to help you install, manage and 
  maintain Frugalware only, not individual applications. The wiki's purpose 
  is to allow everyone to contribute any information that they think might 
  be useful to other Frugalware users. Changes occur so quickly in the FLOSS 
  world that it would impossible to cover everything in the official 
  documentation but a wiki allows collective knowledge to be shared, which 
  is itself a great feature of the FLOSS community.</p>

  <p>Here are some highlights of recent additions and changes to the wiki.</p>

  <ul>
	<li>Elementary Portage - <strong>Updated.</strong> This page is used by 
	Devil505 to track the porting of the Elementary Project's applications 
	to Frugalware;</li>
	
	<li>Plank (Français) - <strong>New.</strong>Details of the simple dock, 
	Plank;</li>
	
	<li>SSH (and SSH (Français)) - <strong> Updated.</strong>Lots of 
	information about SSH</li>
	
	<li>TODO-1.6 - <strong>New.</strong> This page is used to detail what's
	planned for Frugalware release 1.6</li>

	<li>Broadcom wireless (and Broadcom wireless (Français)) - <strong>New.
	</li> Lots if information about Broadcom wireless and various 
	configuration tweaks.</li>
	
	<li>Beatbox (and Beatbox (Français)) - <strong>New.</strong> Information
	about the Beatbox media player.</li>
	
	<li>Frugalware production infrastructure - <strong>New</strong> Details
	of the various servers which form the Frugalware infrastructure.</li>
