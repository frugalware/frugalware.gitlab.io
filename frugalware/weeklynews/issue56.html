  <h2>Frugalware Linux Newsletter - Issue 56</h2>

  <h2>...to inform...to educate...to entertain</h2>

  <p>"It is important that you recognize your progress and take pride in your
  accomplishments. Share your achievements with others. Brag a little. The
  recognition and support of those around you is nurturing."&nbsp;&nbsp;
  Rosemarie Rossetti</p>

  <h2>Welcome</h2>

  <p>The newsletter's aim is to keep you up to date with what's happened
  recently in the world of the Linux distribution 'Frugalware'.</p>

  <p>This issue of the newsletter is a special issue, devoted to a review of
  Frugalware's achievements and events in 2009. There will be a "normal" issue
  published soon. Most of the content in this issue has come from Frugalware
  developer Devil505's blog, with his permission. However any factual errors
  are the responsibility of myself (Phayz).</p>

  <h2>2009 - A Year In Review</h2>

  <p>2009 was a very successful year for Frugalware, with new developers, new
  artwork, work on KDE4 having begun. The two scheduled releases were made on
  time and included some great improvements. Projects such as Fwife (the GUI
  installer) and a live USB option may make Frugalware more attractive to the
  FLOSS community. Blogs are now more active than before and, together with a
  presence on microblogging sites such as identi.ca, make those outside the
  Frugalware community aware that ours is a very active distribution.</p>

  <p>It's important to acknowledge that Frugalware's achievements in 2009 were
  only possible because of the excellent work done in previous years. Thanks go
  to everyone involved, both now and in the past: developers, artists,
  translators and other contributors. In 2009 we had several new developers
  join the project, but we also had several existing developers go quiet or
  leave. For many reasons, people need a rest, or decide to leave the project.
  Regardless of their reasons we thank them for their contribution and wish
  them well in the future.</p>

  <p>Congratulations to everyone involved in the Frugalware community on a
  great year. Let's hope that 2010 is even better.</p>

  <h2>Do you remember when...?</h2>

  <p>Below are some of the highlights of 2009's events and achievements. Do you
  remember where you were when Frugalware 1.0 was released? If I remember
  correctly, I was asleep.</p>

  <h2>January</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <h3>A new developer</h3>

      <p>Elentir was accepted to the development team and immediately began
      working on a Fwife, a GUI installer, soon releasing version 0.3.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <h3>gService</h3>

      <p>Priyank released gService, a GUI service level manager.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <h3>Microblogging arrived</h3>

      <p>Devil505 created a presence on Twitter. With the rise of identi.ca, an
      open (as in "beer" and "free") microblogging service, he also created a
      Frugalware group on that service. git commits began being announced on
      identi.ca.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <h3>Baby steps for Cedynamix</h3>

      <p>Cedynamix, already active in the Ubuntu community, took his first
      steps as a Frugalware contributor.</p>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>February</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <h3>New artwork</h3>

      <p>A new wallpaper was voted by the developer team to be the default for
      Frugalware release 1.0.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <h3>Count with me...1..2..3..4</h3>

      <p>The ext4 filesystem generally having been accepted as an improvement
      over the ext3 filesystem, it was added as an option in the ncurses
      installer.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <h3>Gnome 2.26</h3>

      <p>Gnome 2.26 was released and Bouleetbil began packaging it for
      Frugalware.</p>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>March</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <h3>We made it to 1.0!</h3>

      <p>Frugalware 1.0 - codename 'Anacreon' - was released, with cheers from
      millions of people, street parades and generally a lot of excitement. In
      fact my memory's not very good, so I may be thinking of the election of
      the USA's new president. I'm quite sure, though, that there was a lot of
      excitement on 1.0's release. Five years of hard work by developers,
      artists, translators and other contributors had resulted in a
      distribution to be very proud of.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <h3>A new Gnome in the garden</h3>

      <p>Gnome 2.26 was released to the 'current' repository, thanks to hard
      work by Bouleetbil.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <h3>YAND - Yet Another New Developer</h3>

      <p>After submitting a number of FrugalBuild files, Cedynamix was accepted
      into the Frugalware development team.</p>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>April</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <h3>Devil505 and KDE 4</h3>

      <p>Devil505 began "playing" with KDE 4, working to resolve those problems
      which prevented it being included in Frugalware.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <h3>Crazy returns</h3>

      <p>After a period of convalescence, Crazy returned and began updating the
      GCC chain. Of course anyone else would still have been resting at home,
      but Crazy's dedication to Frugalware is (almost) unstoppable.</p>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>May</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <h3>A new Xfce</h3>

      <p>Xfce 4.6.1 was released to the 'current' repository, thanks to hard
      work by Priyank.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <h3>Publicity for Frugalware</h3>

      <p>VMiklos, Hermier and Bouleetbil were interviewed by Philippe Scoffoni.
      Afterward they all claimed that their fame would not change them at all.
      Is it a coincidence, though, that they began charging US$5 for an
      autograph?</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <h3>Let's meet PAM</h3>

      <p>Bouleetbil began working to integrate PAM into Frugalware, a change
      which had been delayed for as long as possible for technical and security
      reasons.</p>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>June</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <h3>A new X</h3>

      <p>X.org 7.4 was released to the 'current' repository.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <h3>Priyank's new baby</h3>

      <p>Priyank released a new utility just for Frugalware, a Nautilus and
      Thunar GFpm plugin.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <h3>A new developer</h3>

      <p>Jercel was accepted into the development team.</p>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>July</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <h3>A new developer</h3>

      <p>Exceed, a former developer of the Slax-LFI Linux distribution, was
      accepted into the development team.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <h3>Fwife 0.5</h3>

      <p>Elentir released network installation ISOs which used Fwife 0.5.</p>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>August</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <h3>A new KDE in progress</h3>

      <p>Work began to package KDE 4.3.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <h3>CAN YOU HEAR ME!?</h3>

      <p>PulseAudio, a sound server which allows for multiple inputs and
      outputs, was released to the 'current' repository.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <h3>That's WIckeD!</h3>

      <p>WICD, an easy-to-use GUI network connection utility created for the
      Ubuntu distribution, was released to the 'current' repository.</p>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>September</h2>

  <h2>October</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <h3>A new Gnome in the garden</h3>

      <p>Gnome 2.28 was released to the 'current' repository, thanks to hard
      work by Bouleetbil.</p>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>November</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <h3>"The Wiki Returns"</h3>

      <p>No, it's not yet another Star Wars episode. Instead the Frugalware
      wiki was available again after a few technical problems. Many thanks to
      VMiklos, Devil505 and others for retrieving the old content. At the same
      time, it was agreed that the artwork team's wiki would be merged with the
      official wiki. Devil505 began the task of translating content from the
      French-speaking community's wiki and adding this to the official wiki.
      This was one of those situations when you realise how much you need
      something only when it's no longer available. It's a little like moving
      out of home for the first time (for those who have done this and can
      still remember).</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <h3>Live USB</h3>

      <p>Bouleetbil launched into his plan of creating a Live USB option for
      Frugalware.</p>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>December</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>Frugalware developer Crazy hadn't been heard of for some time and so
      some people were a little worried. Thankfully news came direct from Crazy
      that he was recovering in hospital. Finally we could squash those rumours
      about why he had been away for so long, including:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>He had become involved in the Microsoft Windows 7 beta
        programme;</li>

        <li>He had switched to Ubuntu release 9.04 - "Karmic Koala";</li>

        <li>His wife banned him from using any electrical device, even a
        toaster.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li>
      <h3>YAPFB (Yet Another Project For Bouleetbil)</h3>

      <p>Bouleetbil launched into another project, packaging Moblin.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <h3>Farewell Jercel</h3>

      <p>Jercel left the development team for professional reasons.</p>
    </li>
  </ul>
