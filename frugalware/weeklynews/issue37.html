<p><h2>...to inform...to educate...to entertain</h2></p>

<p>You've got to do your own growing, no matter how tall your grandfather was.<br /><em>Irish Proverb</em></p>


<a name="welcome"><h2>Welcome</h2></a>

<p>Features of this issue include:
    <ul>
        <li>Happy New Year!</li>
        <li>When is a Linux distribution like a cake?</li>

<a name="events"><h2>Events</h2></a>

<p>Here's a selection of events which have occurred since the previous newsletter:</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        <h3>Happy New Year!</h3>
        <p>In case you hadn't noticed ( :P ) a new year has begun.  We all hope that 2009 is as successful a year for Frugalware as was 2008.</a></p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h3>Do developers ever sleep?  :)</h3>
        <p>The rate at which packages are updated or added seems to get faster as times goes by.  When Frugalware 0.9 was released I thought the developers might relax a little but instead it seems they began working harder.  Do they ever sleep?</a></p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h3>Bouleetbil - Barista</h3>
        <p>When reviewing the Frugalware changelog I noticed that bouleetbil was maintaining many Java-related packages.  On IRC once day I asked him if he liked coffee, and jokingly suggested that he change his IRC nickname to "barista".  He told me that he does drink a lot of coffee.  I wonder though, is he using Java because he drinks coffee, or did he first use Java and <strong>then</strong> start drinking coffee?  For those who don't already know, 'java' is an old American (USA) slang word for coffee.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h3>When is a Linux distribution like a cake?</h3>
        <p>A Linux distribution is a very complex system.  Each layer is dependent upon the one below it, with the Linux kernel being the base of the "cake". (Hmmm...cake... :P)  Those who maintain packages are responsible for making sure that, as each piece is upgraded, everything else still works.</p>
        <p>I recently read a conversation between ryuo and crazy about the difficulty of upgrading X.  For GUI applications, X is the next layer on top of the Linux kernel, so it's a critical piece.  Although I didn't understand some of what was discussed, it was obvious that you have to be careful when upgrading it.  After the conversation I had to take a few headache tablets and lie down for a while.  :)</p>
        <p>Next time you boot Frugalware, give thanks to all those who keep it running.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h3>Bugs? Squash them!</h3>
        <p>I subscribe to the Frugalware BTS (bug tracking system) mailing list and so see each bug report and request that is made.  I have been surprised recently to see many reports and requests coming from people whose names I haven't seen before.  It's great to know that there are many more people using Frugalware than those in the IRC channels and forums.  Many thanks to all those who take the time to report the bugs they find.  The development team appreciate these reports because as each bug is squashed, the quality of Frugalware is improved.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h3>More artwork!</h3>
        <p>Artwork for a CD case and cover has been added to the collection of artwork for Frugalware 1.0's release.  Well done to the artwork team.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h3>Frugalware 1.0pre2 is almost here</h3>
        <p>This release is due on Tuesday, 13 January 2009.  If you can spare the time and bandwidth, please download and test it.</p>
    </li>
</ul>

<a name="interview"><h2>Frugalware's users are people too - emilpoe</h2></a>

<p>I'm excited to introduce a new feature of the newsletter - interviews with users of Frugalware.  I thought that, with most Frugalware developer and contributor interviews complete, it would be interesting to know a little about Frugalware's users.  I hope you enjoy the very first of this series...</p>

<a name="gettingtoknowyou"><h2>Getting To Know You</h2></a>

    <p>In this section of the newsletter, we get to know Frugalware Linux a little at a time.  This is not meant to replace the official documentation but instead make it easier to read.  This should suit those people who, like me, have short attention spans.  :)</p>

    <h3>"Are we there yet ?"</h3>
    <p>Anyone who has children has experienced the horror of starting on a journey and hearing this question just 1 minute after starting off.  Frugalware is also on a journey and it's interesting to some to know just where we're headed and some of the sights we'll see a long the way.  In Frugalware's Bug Tracking System (BTS) a <a href="http://bugs.frugalware.org/roadmap/proj1">roadmap</a> for the next version is maintained.  If you need to ask "Are we there yet?", simply look at the roadmap.  You might also be interested to read the <a href="http://www.frugalware.org/roadmap">roadmap</a> which is a schedule of each release, including the pre-releases and release candidates.</p>


<a name="tips"><h2>Tips and tricks</h2></a>

    <b>Disclaimer</b> - Be aware that the hints &amp; tips provided here have NOT been tested and so come with no warranty.
<ul>
    <li>
        <h3>Liberation (fonts) - submitted by 'phayz'</h3>
        <p>I know we're all grateful to Microsoft for introducing to the world such wonderful fonts as Arial and Times New Roman.  They're so wonderful that many web developers chose them as the default font(s) for their web sites.  If you don't have these fonts installed on your PC - if you're running Linux for example - the web sites don't look as their designer intended.  One option is to use font substitution so that another font is used when "Arial" is required.  The problem is that the web site <strong>still</strong> won't look quite right.  RedHat have done their best to fix this problem by releasing the <a href="https://fedorahosted.org/liberation-fonts/">Liberation Fonts</a>.  These are free fonts, licenced under the GPL, which are a replacement for Arial, Times News Roman and others.  With these fonts installed, they'll be substituted for the Microsoft version and the web site will look closer to how the designer wanted it to look.</p>

<a name="packages"><h2>Focus On Package(s)</h2></a>

    <h3>Frozen Bubble</h3>

        <img src="http://frugalware.org/images/newsletter/issue37_frozen-bubble_screenshot.png">

        <p>For those who haven't seen <a href="http://www.frozen-bubble.org/">Frozen Bubble</a> game it's a like upside down Tetris.  You control a bubble gun, located at the bottom of the screen.  At the top of the screen are some coloured bubbles.  The aim of the game is to pop all the bubbles.  You do this by shooting a coloured bubble so that it hits one or more bubbles of the same colour.  If a bubble pops, any other bubbles of the same colour that are next to it also pop.  If you pop all the bubbles on the screen you move to the next level.  A platform at the top of the screen slowly pushes the bubbles down toward you and if they touch you, you become frozen.  Frozen Bubble is very easy to play and is a favourite amongst children and adults.  The artwork is excellent, thanks to the graphics artist "ayo".  You can see more of his work <a href="http://www.73lab.com/">here</a>.</p>
