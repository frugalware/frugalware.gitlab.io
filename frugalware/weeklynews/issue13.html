<h2>Events</h2>
<p>
	Here's a selection of events which have occurred since the previous newsletter:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>
	<h3>Anti-aliased fonts in Tk</h3>
	<p>In the continuing effort to make Frugalware the world's best desktop platform, Tcl and Tk 8.5 has been added to the -current repository. Probably the most interesting feature for desktop users is the XFT support, which results in anti-aliased fonts for Tk-based applications like aMSN. You can reach a screenshot <a href="http://frugalware.org/~crazy/amsn_2.png">here</a></p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<h3>VirtualBox just gets better</h3>
		<p>VirtualBox 1.5.4 was added to the -current repository, an amazing 3 days or so after it was released.</p>
	</li>
</ul>

	<h2>Tips and tricks</h2>
	<b>Disclaimer</b> - Be aware that the hints &amp; tips provided here have NOT been tested and so come with no warranty.
<ul>
	<li>
		<h3>Changing rights of files and libraries - submitted by 'bee-carl'</h3>
		<p>Consider a situation where you have downloaded a WordPress theme and the rights of the files and libraries are incorrect.  Or your hard disk has collapsed, so that you have to put a backup from a CD to your new hard disk.<p>
		<p>The following steps will help you correct this situation -</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Navigate to the required folder<br>
				<pre>cd /to/there/where/the_files/are_located</pre></li>
			<li>Change all directories' rights to rwxr-xr-x<br>
				<pre>find . -type d -exec chmod 755 {} \;</pre>
			<li>Change all files' rights to rw-r--r--<br>
				<pre>find . -type f -exec chmod 644 {} \;</pre></li>
		</ol>
	</li>
		<p>Now the rights on files and directories are again correct.</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<h2>Happy New Year</h2>
	<p>Happy New Year to all Frugalware developers and users.
