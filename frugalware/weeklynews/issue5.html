<h2>News</h2>
<p>
	We developers have been doing some cool stuff with Frugalware over the last 2 weeks. Here's what's been happening:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		<h3>XULRunner</h3>
		A new XULRunner package has been added in -current this week and all GNOME apps that have depended upon Firefox for HTML rendering have been rebuilt against XULRunner. This has been requested for ages, and now that it has been done you no longer have to install Firefox if you just want to use Epiphany or Galeon.
	</li>
	<li>
		<h3>FwLive</h3>
		We have made a lot of progress with FwLive, our new LiveCD, over the past few weeks. You can see about the progress and get the latest snapshot ISO image <a href="http://frugalware.org/pipermail/frugalware-devel/2007-May/003584.html">here</a>.
	</li>
	<li>
		<h3>New Frugalware 0.7 GTK+2 theme</h3>
		A new GTK+2 theme was uploaded to -current last week, and it is now the default theme for GNOME and XFCE. There are a few known problems with it, such as the nasty looking tabs, but they will be fixed in due course. You can see a screenshot <a href="http://frugalware.org/~alex/screenies/fw07gnome.png">here</a>.
	</li>
	<li>
		<h3>Pidgin in -current</h3>
		Many of you who use Gaim will have known that it has been renamed to Pidgin after a legal problem with AOL. Pidgin 2.0.0 was released a few days ago, it has been added in -current and all the plugins have been updated accordingly. This new version comes with many features and brand new icons. I'd like to congratulate the Pidgin developers for a great release :)
	</li>
	<li>
		<h3>OpenMotif replaces Lesstif</h3>
		We have replaced Lesstif with OpenMotif. All packages have been rebuilt accordingly, but there may be some problems. If you find any please report them to our bug tracker. Thanks!
	</li>
	<li>
		<h3>FFMpeg upgraded</h3>
		FFMpeg was upgraded in -current this week. As with OpenMotif, all packages have been rebuilt accordingly, but there still may be some problems, in which case please report them to our bug tracker. Thanks!
	</li>
	<li>
		<h3>New Pacman-G2 release</h3>
		We released a new pacman-g2 release today, which provides several fixes and improvements (including a fix for a segfault several people have encountered with the installer, fix will be in 0.7pre1), and a new -Qt option which helps to check for problems in your package database.
	</li>
</ul>

<h2>Tips and tricks</h2>
<p>
	Here are some tips and tricks that have been discovered by our users to help make using your Frugalware system even easier and make your system even faster. Remember that this section relies on your contributions! If you have some tips and tricks that you would like to be shown in the newsletter, post them on the forums in the Tips and Tricks section!
</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		<h3>Find out how much space is being used on your home directory</h3>
		If you find that your /home partition (or any other partition in fact) is low on disk space, the following command is useful:<br />
		<code>du -h --max-depth=1 &lt;home directory&gt;</code><br />
		This will give you the total disk space being used by each sub-directory of the directory. Thanks to phayz for this tip.
	</li>
	<li>
		<h3>Display extended search options in the GNOME search function</h3>
		Go to: /apps/gnome-search-tool/ in gconf-editor and enable: show_additional_options. Thanks to detto for this tip!
	</li>
