  <p>Here’s a selection of recent events and other items that you might find
  interesting:</p>

  <h3>Frugalware release 1.4 <em>Nexon</em> has arrived!</h3>

  <p>On 13 February 2011, VMiklos <a href="http://frugalware.org/news/197">
  announced</a> the release of Frugalware Linux version 1.4, code- name <em>
  Nexon</em>, with many exciting improvements. The number of developers and 
  contributors has been increasing, with an amazing total of 31 for this 
  release, the largest ever number for any Frugalware release! It’s always 
  great to have new people joining, bringing their ideas and enthusiasm. 
  Judging by this, it appears that Frugalware Linux will have a bright 
  future.</p>

  <h3>Frugalware website has had a facelift</h3>

  <p>Developer Devil505 and others have made some fantastic improvements to the
  appearance of the Frugalware web site with:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>layout changes;</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p>a new set of icons;</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p>a cool-looking popup display for screenshots.</p>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>Icons are used with news and newsletter items to visually identify their
  topics. The new icons were chosen from the Faenza set which is currently very
  popular with many Linux distributions, including ours. The layout changes,
  together with the new icons give the site a fresh, modern look. I added icons
  to each section of the newsletter a few months ago, but was not entirely
  happy with their position. Unfortunately I didn’t know enough to fix the
  situation. I’m very happy, then, that Devil505 has not only changed the icons
  but moved them to the right-hand side of the page. This change, together with
  the new icons, is a big improvement to the newsletter’s appearance.</p>

  <p>The appearance of screenshots on the web site has been improved so that
  when you click on a screenshot, the full-size image will appear in a pop-up
  window, overlaid on the content of the web page. The advantage of this
  approach is that you can see the image in context, which makes for a better
  understanding.</p>

  <h3>Home page has been translated into Spanish and Italian</h3>

  <p>Thanks mainly to community member DarkNekros and developer Melko, the
  Frugalware home page has been translated into Spanish and Italian. We are
  keen to make Frugalware available to as many people as possible in their
  native language. These translations are a step toward that goal so thanks go
  to them for their help. A series of small flag icons appears on the home page
  as a visual prompt of which languages the home page has been translated. If
  any part of Frugalware is not yet translated into your native language and
  you’re able to help do that, <strong>please</strong> do. To get started, send
  an email to the Frugalware developers' mailing list.</p>

  <h3>Fwife gets better with age (and attention from Elentir :) )</h3>

  <p>Fwife is the Frugalware GUI installer which, from Frugalware release 1.4
  "Nexon", is included together with the ncurses installer on the ISOs. There
  have been two main changes to Fwife: mount point improvements and a
  standalone installation option. In the previous version of Fwife the
  configuration of mount points was not intuitive but this has been made much
  clearer. It’s been amazing to see Fwife develop from an idea proposed on the
  mailing list to being a part of the official release. And this has been the
  work of just one person - Elentir - with the support of the development team,
  of course. Congratulations.</p>

  <h3>Let’s Disqus it, OK?</h3>

  <p>In case you haven’t already noticed, you can now make comments about each
  newsletter issue at the bottom of the page. This allows us two-way
  communication with our users and hopefully better understanding between us.
  Now that comments are open, please do tell us what you think.</p>

  <p>The idea of making comments possible came from the development team. Some
  of their blogs use a service provided by <a href=
  "http://disqus.com">Disqus</a>, which allows you to easily add a comments
  feature to otherwise static web pages. Since the Frugalware web site is
  custom PHP, not a CMS, using Disqus chosen as the best way of achieving what
  we wanted. All comments are collected centrally, so it’s easier to review
  and, if necessary, moderate feedback. With this feedback we can tweak and
  tune the newsletter to keep you better informed and entertained.</p>

  <div class="postheader">Tips and Tricks</div>
  <img class="face" src="/images/newsletter/terminal.png" width="85" height="85" alt="" /><br />

  <p><strong>Disclaimer</strong> - Be aware that the hints &amp; tips provided
  here have NOT been tested and so come with no warranty.</p>

  <h3>Multi-boot Frugalware and…Frugalware</h3>

  <p>When you think of booting multiple operating systems on the same hardware,
  you would usually be thinking of <em>different</em> operating systems. What
  about running the same operating system, Frugalware of course? Running two
  installations can be useful in situations where a fatal operating system
  error prevents you from using your computer. With another installation of
  Frugalware you could simply reboot to it and voila, you’re productive again.
  While you could troubleshoot the problem, there are many situations where you
  simply couldn’t afford the time required. If you were about to give a
  presentation you would (hopefully) be more worried about starting, not
  troubleshooting. Try this tip and one day it just might "rescue" you.</p>

  <h3>Get fit with Frugalware</h3>

  <p>It’s well known that many geeks don’t get as much exercise as they should.
  To encourage more activity and so have a healthier population, here are a few
  suggestions:</p>

  <h4>Remove cron</h4>

  <p>Cron is a tool which can schedule tasks to be run at specified days and
  time. Instead of using cron, write down on a piece of paper when tasks need
  to be run and enter the necessary commands at the scheduled time.</p>

  <h4>Don’t use <tt>pacman-g2 -Su</tt></h4>

  <p>Instead of having pacman-g2 check for and update all packages, check them
  manually. Use the command <tt>pacman-g2 -Q</tt> to get a list of installed
  packages. For every package installed, check if it’s up to date with the
  command <tt>pacman-g2 -S &lt;package_name&gt;</tt>.</p>

  <h4>Use another text editor</h4>

  <p>Whatever text editor you normally use, switch to another one, preferably
  one which you have never used before. Make sure it’s a really complex editor,
  like Emacs or vi. There’s no excuse for switching from Mousepad to gedit, for
  example. As you struggle to find the right commands or key sequences, and
  your brain’s temperature rises from cool to hot, you will use up a lot of
  energy.</p>

  <p>These are just examples of what you can do to improve your overall fitness
  level. Once you get a little fitter you might like to take the next step and
  go for a walk outside, maybe even ride a bike. Soon it could be a new, fitter
  you who is sitting in front of your computer.</p>

  <p><strong>Disclaimer:</strong> The above advice is general advice only and
  results can’t be guaranteed. Factors which may affect your results include:
  keystroke rate, choice of new text editor and alignment of the planets.</p>

  <p>This section relies on your contributions! If you have some tips and
  tricks that you would like to be shown in the newsletter, <em>please</em>
  post them on the forums.</p>

  <div class="postheader">New Packages</div>
  <img class="face" src="/images/newsletter/package-new.png" width="85" height="85" alt="" /><br />

  <h3>tig</h3>

  <p>tig is a console application which allows you to browse git repositories.
  It has two modes: browse, which allows you to browse through the commits and
  see the associated diffs and pager, where tig takes input from stdin and
  applies colours to the output. When you first start Browse mode,</p>

  <p>Browse mode is great because you can quickly navigate through commits and
  their associated diffs. It also allows you to quickly switch between
  different views where "views" match the view-* git options: view-diff, view
  tree etc. A basic searching option is useful when you need to find something
  specific.</p>

  <p>Pager mode is quite simple because it takes input from stdin and applies
  colours to the various fields: commit reference, author, date. You simply
  type your git command and pipe it to tig and you’re then in pager mode, able
  to browse the command’s output in colour.</p>

  <p>The great thing about tig is that it doesn’t try to hide git from you, or
  limit what you can do. It uses git’s own commands and accepts all git-log and
  git-diff options as well as some tig-specific options. I would strongly
  recommend tig to anyone who works with git repositories.</p>

  <h3>Shutter</h3>

  <p>To be honest, when I first heard of Shutter, which on its About page is
  described as a "Featureful Screenshot Tool" I thought "Why? We already have
  screenshot tools!" Surely you display a window and take a screenshot of
  either a window or the entire desktop, end of story. In fact this is where
  the life of a screenshot usually starts, because it’s often then resized,
  cropped, converted to another format, then uploaded to a site so that others
  can see it. With Shutter you can all this, and more, easily and without
  needing to use other applications. If you need to capture and edit a series
  of screenshots you easily do this because they’re all loaded in a tabbed
  interface. Also available is a great range of plugins which allows you to
  enhance the appearance of the screenshot, from making it look like a
  Polaroid, to applying a 3D reflection. A feature which I don’t recall seeing
  in other tools is the ability to capture a screenshot of an application’s
  menu or tooltip. If you do <strong>any</strong> work with screenshots then
  definitely try Shutter because it may save you a lot of effort.</p>
