  <p>Here’s a selection of recent events and other items that you might find
  interesting:</p>

  <h4>Frugalware Linux version 1.5 released</h4>

  <p>On 15 August 2011, developer VMiklos <a href= 
  "http://permalink.gmane.org/gmane.linux.frugalware.announce/114">announced 
  </a> the release of Frugalware Linux version 1.5, code name "Mores". 
  Although a stable release is made every six months, this was a significant 
  release with some major changes, including: systemd now being the default 
  init system and an initial ARM port. It was also the first release for 
  several of the newest members of the development team. Congratulations to 
  everyone involved.</p>

  <h4>Frugalware Release Party was "up in the air"</h4>

  <p>In accordance with tradition, a party was held to celebrate the latest
  Frugalware Linux release. The French team members had prepared a banquet
  at the top of the Eiffel Tower and everyone drank, ate and generally
  enjoyed themselves. Unfortunately someone had forgotten that the very top
  of the tower is very narrow and so only three team members could be at the
  top at the same time. It all worked out well, though, because Devil505 had
  brought his new netbook and /dev/random was used to choose when everyone
  went to the top.</p>

  <p>A highlight of the celebrations was a parachute jump high above Paris.
  While free-falling, everyone arranged themselves in formation to represent
  the Frugalware logo. <em>Someone</em>, whose name is to be kept a secret,
  started to make the <em>Fedora</em> logo instead but was quickly corrected
  by the other team members. They claim that anyone could have confused the
  Fedora 'f' with our 'F' but it still seems a little suspicious. Anyway,
  the logo appeared briefly in the bright blue Parisian sky and everyone
  landed safely. We haven't decided how we might celebrate the release of
  Frugalware Linux version 1.6 but maybe we'll keep our feet on the ground.
  </p>

  <h4>Slown is officially a developer</h4>
  
  <p>Frugalware user Slown had recently submitted a number of FrugalBuilds
  for new packages. After some initial reviews, VMiklos realised that his
  work no longer need review and so invited Slown to become an official
  member of the Frugalware development team. Congratulations to Slown and
  we look forward to many more packages in the future.</p>

  <h4>Cedynamix is back!</h4>
  
  <p>Just as we welcome Slown to the team, developer Cedynamix has returned
  after a break. We're not sure just what he's been doing but we've searched
  other Linux distributions' activity and are satisfied that he's not been
  working elsewhere. Welcome back Cedynamix.</p>
  
  <h4>Balint is helping with German translation</h4>
  
  <p>Frugalware user Balint (AKA Sigo) is helping with the translation into 
  German of the various Frugalware projects. Help in this area is always 
  welcome because we would like Frugalware to be accessible in everyone's 
  native language. Even if someone is already providing translations you can 
  help because it's good to have someone review the work of others and point 
  out problems or raise questions, whether it's code or translation.</p>

  <h4>Bash Shell Aliases</h4>

  <p>If you often type the same command or series of commands in a shell,
  then aliases will save you time. An alias replaces a user-defined command
  with other shell commands. The idea is that typing a short command and
  having either a longer command or several commands occur saves you time
  and effort. Here is a very simple Bash shell alias:</p>

  <code>alias pu='pacman-g2 -Syu'</code>

  <p>With this alias defined, when you enter the command "pu" in a
  Bash shell, "pacman-g2 -Syu" will actually be run instead. Keep in
  mind that aliases are simply shorter versions of commands you
  would normally type.</p>

  <p>If you often use the same set of options for a command, an alias is an
  easy way of setting those as the default. For example, if you want to always
  use the "-h" option for the "df" (Disk Free) command, you can define the
  following alias:</p>

  <code>alias df='df -h'</code>

  <p>You might think that this would create an infinite loop, but it
  doesn't. :) When you now enter the command "df", the "-h" option is always
  added. Note that you can't use replaceable parameters in an alias but if
  you have such a need, use a shell function instead.</p>

  <p>To see a list of all currently defined aliases, enter "alias" in a 
  terminal. User-defined aliases are configured in your Bash configuration 
  file: ~/.bashrc. Changes to this file don't take effect immediately but 
  you can activate them by entering the command ". ~/.bashrc". Note the 
  space between the first full stop/period (.) and the Bash configuration 
  file. This has only been a very brief coverage of Bash aliases, so refer 
  to the Bash man page for more details. A little time learning just some of 
  its features will certainly save you time in the long run.</p>


  <h4>Tell me when you're finished</h4>

  <p>If you're running a command in a terminal emulator that you expect to
  take a while, it's boring to sit, watch and wait for it to finish. If you
  install the "libnotify" package you have a very useful application
  available: notify-send. This application allows you to specify from the
  command line a custom popup message to appear on the desktop. The content
  of the message and for how long it remains visible are all customisable.
  Here's an example command which will popup a message when a CLI command
  is complete:</p>

  <code>wget &lt;file&gt; ; notify-send --urgency=critical &quot;File
  download is complete.&quot;</code>

  <p>In this case a message with the text "File download is complete." will 
  appear after the command has exited. I can't remember what happens under 
  Xfce or KDE but on GNOME 3 a message with an urgency of "critical" stays 
  visible until you click on it. Messages with other urgency ratings will 
  hide again after a brief delay. notify-send doesn't have a man page but 
  you can see all available parameters by entering "notify-send -?".</p>

  <p>The next time you're downloading an ISO or perhaps converting video
  files from one format to another, try notify-send and give yourself some
  free time. :)</p>

  <h4>Do you have any tips or tricks to share?</h4>

  <p>If you have some tips and tricks that you would like to share, <em>
  please</em> post them on the forums or in the comments section below.</p>

  <br />
  <div class="postheader">Focus on Packages</div>
  <img class="face" src="/images/newsletter/package-new.png" width="85" height="85" alt=""><br>

  <h4>Gource</h4>

  <p>My knowledge of version control systems (VCS) is roughly the same as my 
  knowledge of cars: I can operate them well enough to get me from A to B 
  but don't know how to fix them if something goes wrong. When I read about 
  new utilities for VCS I get a little worried, thinking that I just might 
  do more harm than good but I can't help being curious. You run <a href= 
  "http://code.google.com/p/gource/">Gource</a> in a terminal, providing the 
  path to a VCS repository as a parameter, with support for VCS including 
  git, Subversion and Mercurial. In a window, Gource draws bright blobs 
  which represent the objects in the repository and lines between them to 
  represent the links between the objects. It works forward through the 
  repository's history, illustrating the changes in the repository by 
  dynamically changing the displayed blobs and lines. It looks a little like 
  a fireworks screensaver but it's much more interesting to watch. Try it 
  for yourself and I'm sure you'll be entertained, possibly for hours. :D</p>

  <img src="/images/newsletter/issue82_screenshot_gource.png" alt="Gource 
  screenshot" title= "Gource screenshot" />

  <h4>Duplicity</h4>

  <p><a href="">Duplicity</a> is a CLI backup application with two major 
  features: it encrypts the backups and uses the librsync utility, which 
  minimises the amount of disk space required. The backups themselves are 
  encrypted with GnuPG and can be stored on either a local or remote file 
  server, with options including: ftp, ssh/scp,  rsync,  WebDAV,  WebDAVs, 
  HSi, IMAP, Ubuntu One and Amazon S3. The first backup of any directory 
  will be a full backup but any subsequent backups are incremental, making 
  Duplicity very efficient on disk space. Command-line parameters allow you 
  to specify exactly what you want, allowing for a full backup if you 
  specifically want it, exclusion of specific directories, and the option of 
  verifying what's on the source is an exact copy of what's contained in the 
  specified backup. All operations are logged for review if needed.</p>

  <p>Backups are useful only if you can recover what you need <em>when</em> 
  you need it. Duplicity offers plenty of options, including restoration of 
  individual files and directories, also time-based restoration. To restore 
  the directory /home/me to as it was at the most recent backup:</p>

  <pre>duplicity scp://uid@other.host/some_dir /home/me</pre>

  <p>To restore an individual file to as it was 3 days ago:</p>

  <pre>duplicity -t 3D --file-to-restore Mail/article 
  scp://uid@other.host/some_dir /home/me/restored_file</pre>

  <p>Slown's screenshot was submitted on 31 August 2011 and features the
  Xfce desktop with an extra, transparent panel at the bottom for
  application launchers. To be honest I'm not entirely sure of any of this
  but that's what I <em>think</em> it is. If I'm wrong I hope Slown will
  correct me. :D</p>

	  <dd>Unfortunately wireless support in Linux is still a topic which is a
	  problem for many people. Broadcom is one of the most common brands of
	  wireless chipsets and so it's great that Devil505 has added some
	  troubleshooting information to this page.</dd>

	  <dt>XFCE</dt>

	  <dd>User Korrode added a tip for XFCE for getting "Open" and "Show in
	  Folder" working. I have had this problem myself but didn't know to fix it.</dd>

	  <dt>Virtualbox</dt>

	  <dd>User and contributor Botchchikii has added a French-language page
	  about Virtualbox.</dd>

	  <dt>UUID</dt>
	  <dd>Developer Devil505 has added a page about UUID, a scheme for persistent
	  naming of block devices.</dd>
