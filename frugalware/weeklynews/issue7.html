<h2>News</h2>
<p>
	Here's what's happened over the last few weeks:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		<h3>Happy 3rd Birthday!</h3>
		Yesterday was the 3rd birthday of Frugalware! We'd like to thank all of our users for helping us to have a great three years, and we hope it gets even better!
	</li>
	<li>
		<h3>Homepage design contest</h3>
		That's it, time is up for the homepage contest! Voting is now open: If you would like to vote for the design which you think should become the new Frugalware homepage, please head over to the <a href="/~alex/designs/">voting page</a>!
	</li>
	<li>
		<h3>Documentation now available on package search</h3>
		When you search for a package on the homepage, you are now given an option to view the documentation for it if documentation is provided. Also, some documentation has been added for some more packages: <a href="http://frugalware.org/packages/65/documentation">cyrus-sasl</a>, <a href="http://frugalware.org/packages/423/documentation">openssh</a>, <a href="http://frugalware.org/packages/457/documentation">postfix</a>, <a href="http://frugalware.org/packages/365/documentation">lvm2</a> and <a href="http://frugalware.org/packages/890/documentation">user-mode-linux</a>
	</li>
	<li>
		<h3>Vim spellcheck dictionary packages</h3>
		We have added spellcheck dictionary packages for Vim in -current. If your language is missing, just file a feature request.
	</li>
	<li>
		<h3>Changing the Frugalware SCM</h3>
		Discussion has been going on about switching away from Darcs to another SCM. Our main repo currently has over 25,000 patches, and it is getting quite slow under the load. We would like to switch to something faster. The current possibilities are Git and Mercurial. Stay tuned for more info on this.
