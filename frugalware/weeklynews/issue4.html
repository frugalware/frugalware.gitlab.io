<h2>News</h2>
<p>
	Here's the low-down on what's been happening in Frugal-land this week:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		<h3>Upstart delayed</h3>
		Unfortunately Upstart won't make 0.7pre1 due to time limitations on my part, and also some stuff is missing in Upstart itself (the ability to disable/enable services), but these things are being worked on. However, Upstart will definitely make 0.7pre2.
	</li>
	<li>
		<h3>Kernel 2.6.21 in current</h3>
		The latest 2.6.21 kernel has hit the current repository! This new kernel brings many speedups, new drivers and an update to the KVM virtualization drivers. Our KVM package has been updated accordingly.
	</li>

		<h3>Missing icons in XFCE Settings manager</h3>
		Many of you might have noticed that some icons are missing in the Xfce settings manager. However this doesn't occur with the new XFCE, still if it does, run the following command as root: <br /><br />
		<code>gtk-update-icon-cache -f -t /usr/share/icons/hicolor</code><br /><br />
		
		Thanks to Priyank for this tip!
	</li>
	<li>
		<h3>Changing the icon theme in NON Xfce/Gnome/GTK environment</h3>

		Open /usr/share/icons/hicolor/index.theme and add the following line:<br /><br />
		<code>
		Inherits="name of the icon theme"<br />
		example: Inherits="gnome"
		</code>
		<br /><br />
		or
		<br /><br />
		Open ~/.gtkrc.mine (or create it if it doesn't exist) and add this line:<br /><br />

		<code>gtk-icon-theme-name = "name of the icon theme"</code><br /><br />
		
		Thanks to Priyank for this tip!
	</li>

		<h3>Change the number of recent files shown in the Gedit editor menu.</h3>
		Go to: /apps/gedit-2/preferences/ui/recents/ with gconf-editor and change: max_recents - Thanks to detto for this tip!
