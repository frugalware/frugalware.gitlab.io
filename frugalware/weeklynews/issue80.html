  <p>Here’s a selection of recent events and other items that you might find
  interesting:</p>

  <h4>Frugalware 1.5 pre2 - "Mores" released</h4>
  
  <p>On 20 June 2011, developer VMiklos proudly <a href=
  "http://frugalware.org/news/207">announced</a> the release of Frugalware 
  Linux 1.5 pre-release 2, the latest in the testing series for the next 
  major version. Included are some important upgrades and changes, including 
  a switch to the Plymouth init system. If you have some bandwidth and time 
  available, please test this pre-release so the final release is as 
  bug-free as possible.</p>

  <h4>Baste is officially a developer</h4>

  <p>As I predicted in newsletter issue 79, Sébastien VINCENT (AKA
  Baste) is officially a Frugalware developer. Congratulations and
  thankyou for the work you've done so far. It's great to see new
  people joining the community and contributing to the future
  success of Frugalware.</p>

  <h4>Bug in Bug Fixes section of the newsletter :O</h4>
  
  <p>The Bug Fixes section of the newsletter gives an overview of the
  activity in the Bug Tracking System (BTS) since the previous issue.
  Each of the numbers in this section is a hyperlink to what should be
  a list of the specific bug reports or feature requests. Frugalware
  user Marius Cirsta recently reported that the numbers in the table
  didn't match what you saw when you followed the hyperlink. As soon
  as this was reported I checked and confirmed that it was true.
  Apologies to everyone for this error, also for not checking each
  issue. I have corrected the statistics in this issue but won't be
  correcting all old issues. Many thanks to Marius for finding and
  reporting this problem.</p>

  <h4>You can do a lot in just 15 minutes</h4>

  <p>Frugalware developer Bouleetbil</a> has recently posted a
  series of blog posts which demonstrate how easily and quickly you
  can set up network services including: a proxy, VPN and SSH
  server. He gives clear instructions which will have the service
  installed and running literally in 5 minutes, on Frugalware of
  course. Next time you have 5 minutes spare, try one of his "quick
  cook recipes".</p>

  <h4><em>Please</em> tell me you like me</h4>

  <p>To help spread knowledge of Frugalware Linux, developer Devil505 
  recently added buttons for various social networks in the side panel of 
  the web site. Whether you want to use Twitter, Facebook or Google +1, 
  click on the matching button and tell everyone you're a Frugalware fan.</p>

  <h4>Orphaned packages find new "homes"</h4>

  <p>A Frugalware package whose maintainer is no longer active is
  considered "orphaned", since there's no-one caring for it any
  more. A list of all orphaned packages is maintained on a wiki page
  and developers are encouraged to take over their ownership.
  Recently many of them have been adopted by new parents
  (maintainers) and the list has been gradually getting shorter.
  When a package is adopted everyone has tears in their eyes,
  although for the new maintainer I'm not sure if they're tears of
  joy. It's not certain what happens if we can't find a maintainer
  for an orphaned package, although there's always /dev/null.</p>

  <h4>New features for pacman-g2</h4>
  
  <p>Two new features were recently added to pacman-g2: a new operation and
  a new Query option.</p>

  <h5>pacman-g2 -P</h5>

  <p>The new operation uses the parameter "-P" or "--ps" and lists all
  processes which are using deleted files. From this information you can
  confirm if any services are affected and if so, restart them.</p>

  <h5>pacman-g2 -Qf</h5>

  <p>The new Query option "-Qf" checks the specified package or all packages 
  (if a specific package is not given) to confirm if all the files owned by 
  that package are present. This option is very useful if you believe a 
  package might be incomplete; perhaps you think a library file might be 
  missing. Here's sample output you would see if a file was missing:</p>

  <pre>pacman-g2 /usr/share/doc/pacman-g2-3.8.2/TODO	No such file or directory.</pre>

  <p>For full details of all pacman-g2's operations and options, refer to its
  man page.</p>


  <h4>Maintain a list of installed packages</h4>

  <p>This tip has featured in the newsletter before but it's definitely 
  worth repeating. Most of us install the same packages, no matter which PC 
  we're working on, but it's impossible to remember all their names. If you 
  run the command "pacman-g2 -Q" (with root privileges) and redirect its 
  output to a file, you have a record of all installed packages. If you want
  to have this list automatically updated, set it up as a cron job, perhaps
  using a file name based on the current date.</p>
  
  <p>To take this tip one step further, the output of the above command can 
  be used as input to pacman-g2 to install all listed packages. This can be 
  very useful if for example, you're installing on another computer and want 
  exactly the same set of packages or have deleted a Frugalware installation 
  and are starting again. Using this method you only need to install the 
  'base' group of packages then use the following command to install 
  everything listed in the file.</p>

  <pre>pacman-g2 -S --ask 32 `sed 's/ .*//' file`</pre>
  
  <p><em>Thanks to VMiklos for providing the command used in this tip.

  <h4>Do you have any tips or tricks to share?</h4>

  <p>This section relies on your contributions! If you have some tips and
  tricks that you would like to share, <em>please</em> post them on the forums
  or the comments section below.</p>
  
  <br />
  <div class="postheader">Focus on Packages</div>
  <img class="face" src="/images/newsletter/package-new.png" width="85" height="85" alt=""><br>

  <h4>Minitube</h4>

  <p>Watching YouTube videos in a web browser has its problems, since it 
  requires a Flash plugin. <a href="http://flavio.tordini.org/minitube">
  Minitube</a> aims to make this easier because it allows you to watch them 
  in a GUI application instead. The user interface is quite simple, with a 
  search input field that allows you to search videos or channels by 
  keywords. Once you have found what you're looking for you can play the 
  video immediately or add it to a playlist. Often people publish to YouTube 
  educational videos or "screencasts" and Minitube's playlist feature is 
  very useful because you can set up the videos to play in order.</p>

  <p>Playing a video is very easy to operate, with the standard controls in 
  a bar just below the main menu. You can choose from three user interface 
  modes while playing a video: standard, compact and fullscreen. If you want 
  to save the video to watch later, you simply choose Video > Download from 
  the main menu. If instead you want to refer to the video, perhaps to 
  link to it in a blog post or email, you can copy the URL for the YouTube 
  page or the YouTube stream alone, again from the Video menu.</p>
  
  <p>Minitube is perhaps the easiest way of finding and playing YouTube
  videos. It's definitely recommended for all Frugalware users who have
  visited YouTube more than once.</p>

  <img src="issue80_screenshot_minitube.png" width="400">
  
  <h4>Plank</h4>
  
  <p>There are some applications of which developers can't seem to resist 
  writing their own version. The FLOSS world has more text editors and media 
  players than most people have had hot meals. The latest trend seems to be 
  docks, those GUI panels which appear at the side of the screen and contain 
  launchers and various widgets. <a href="https://launchpad.net/plank">Plank
  </a> is YAD (Yet Another Dock) being developed in Vala by the elementaryOS 
  core team. It's a very new project and doesn't have all the features of 
  other docks but work is progressing quickly. Plank has very few 
  dependencies so it's suitable for use with a desktop environment or 
  standalone window manager.</p>
  
  <p>Like most other docks it shows a set of icons which when clicked launch 
  the matching application. A light glow appears under an icon if that 
  application is already running. If you click on the icon of a running 
  application, Plank brings that application into focus and if needed, 
  switches desktops. To keep out of your way, Plank can be set to always 
  hide, requiring you to move the mouse cursor near it before it will 
  appear, or hide intelligently, in whch case it will hide only when 
  overlapped by other windows. Try Plank for yourself because after all, one 
  more dock isn't going to hurt anyone. :)</p>

  <div class="postheader">Users' Desktop Screenshots</div>
  <img class="face" src="/images/newsletter/desktop.png" width="85" height="85" alt=""><br>

  <p>This new section of the newsletter features screenshots of users' desktop
  configurations. Whether we use a desktop environment or only a window
  manager, most of us like to tweak the appearance of our desktop until it
  looks just right. With almost endless configuration options it can become an
  obsession. The screenshots which appear in this section are examples of what
  you can achieve. You may not like them all but you may learn about an option
  or application that you didn't know before. If the creator of the screenshot
  has provided details of the configuration, these are provided below.</p>

  <p>If you would like to submit your own desktop screenshot, please submit it
  the Frugalware forums and I'll copy it from there.</p>

  <h4>FrugalNL</h4>

  <p>FrugalNL's desktop screenshot was submitted on 3 June 2011 and features 
  Xfce and the system monitor Conky. The wallpaper is beautiful but I'm 
  honestly not sure what it features; it looks like a woman doing a double <a
  href="FIXME - add reference">face-palm</a>. Maybe she was running Windows 
  at the time? :P</p>

  <h4>PassionGNULinux</h4>

  <p>PassionGNULinux's desktop screenshot was submitted on 6 May 2011 and 
  features what looks to be GNOME 3 with the Frugalware theme.<strong>
  WARNING:</strong> Don't look at the screenshot if you're afraid of 
  spiders.</p>

  <h4>Slown</h4>
  
  <p>OK - I know Slown had a desktop screenshot featured in the previous 
  newsletter but with a wallpaper like this I couldn't resist. This 
  screenshot was submitted on 11 June 2011 and features Xfce 4.8.</p>

  <h4>Devil505</h4>

  <p>Again, I know that Devil505 has already had a desktop screenshot 
  featured in the newsletter. It's amazing what $20 can buy so here in full
  colour is his latest excellent and truly amazing screenshot. :P</p>

  <div class="postheader">From the wiki to you...</div>
  <img class="face" src="/images/newsletter/wiki.png" width="85" height="85" /><br />

  <p>The wiki is a very useful source of information about Frugalware, 
  hardware and applications. Sometimes the question is asked: what should go 
  in the wiki and what should go in the official manual? The general 
  guideline is that the manual's purpose is to help you install, manage and 
  maintain Frugalware only, not individual applications. The wiki's purpose 
  is to allow everyone to contribute any information that they think might 
  be useful to other Frugalware users. Changes occur so quickly in the FLOSS 
  world that it would impossible to cover everything in the official 
  documentation but a wiki allows collective knowledge to be shared, which 
  is itself a great feature of the FLOSS community.</p>

  <p>Here are some highlights of recent additions and changes to the wiki.</p>

  <ul>
	<li>MSI Wind U200 - <strong>Added</strong> Information about the MSI 
	Wind U200 laptop.</li>
	<li>HP 2140 netbook - <strong>Added</strong> 
	Information about the Hewlett-Packard 2140 netbook</li>
	<li>Dropbox - updated to match changes to the Dropbox package</li>
	<li>GNOME Shell extensions - <strong>Added</strong> Information about
	various unofficial GNOME Shell extensions</li>
	<li>DboxFE - <strong>Added</strong>is a frontend for DOSBox.</li>
	<li>SSH- <strong>Added</strong> A lot of information about SSH.</li>

  <p><strong>Remember</strong> - According to the normal support arrangements
  for Frugalware, the release of 1.4 ("Nexon") means that no further security
  or bug fixes will be released for Frugalware 1.3 ("Haven") or earlier.</p>

  <p>Here is a list of <a href="/security">security issues</a> which have 
  been discovered and fixed in the 1.4 release since the previous newsletter.

  <h4>Author</h4>

  <p>The Frugalware newsletter is written and edited by Russell Dickenson (AKA
  phayz). Credit for the Frugalware distribution goes to the development
  team.</p>

  <h4>Release</h4>

  <p>To allow time for review and corrections, each newsletter is written ahead
  of its release date. Therefore it may not mention events which occurred in
  the few days before its release - e.g. security fixes. To be sure that you’ve
  got the very latest information on these topics, go to the appropriate page
  of the Frugalware web site.</p>
