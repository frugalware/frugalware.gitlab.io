  <h2>Events</h2>

  <p>Here's a selection of events which have occurred since the previous
  newsletter:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <h3>New Frugalware user bars</h3>

      <p>Juky, a member of the Frugalware artwork team, has produced some new
      Frugalware user bars, for display on your own web site, forums etc. User
      bars were already available, but those were labelled with the URL of the
      French-language Frugalware web site. While this is an excellent site, the
      new user bars refer to the official Frugalware web site. Thanks to Juky
      for his excellent work. The user bars can be found at <a href=
      "http://www.frugalware-art.org/">Frugalware's artwork site</a>.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <h3>Frugalware logo added to OpenLogos font</h3>

      <p>The OpenLogos font is a TrueType font containing Linux and
      FLOSS-related logos. At Devil505's request, the creator of the font added
      two versions of the Frugalware logo. Many thanks to Mr. Zafar for
      creating the font, and thanks to Devil505 for asking him to add the
      Frugalware logo. As Devil505 mentions on his <a href=
      "http://devil505.tuxfamily.org/">French-language blog</a>, an example use
      for the logo is with Conky because you can put the Frugalware logo beside
      your PC's information.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <h3>French-language mailing list</h3>

      <p>To assist those who speak the French language, a French-language users
      mailing list has been created. To subscribe or un-subscribe to this list,
      go <a href="http://frugalware.org/mailman/listinfo">here</a> to the
      Frugalware mailing lists administration page. Unlike the other user
      mailing lists, though, entries made in the official French-language forum
      won't appear in the French-language mailing list, and vice versa.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <h3>We have a new developer!</h3>

      <p>VMiklos recently proposed that Jercel become a member of the
      development team. He has submitted just under 10 FrugalBuilds and, after
      help from the development team, his work has been accepted. The vote was
      very positive and Jercel is now an official developer. Congratulations to
      Jercel. It's been exciting to see several new people join the development
      team in recent months.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <h3>Question - "What microblogging client does a frog use?"</h3>

      <p>Answer - froggymicroblog. Please read on because it does get better, I
      promise. :) Like several Frugalware developers, Bouleetbil does more than
      work on Frugalware. He recently developed a GUI, Mono-based microblogging
      client named <a href=
      "http://code.google.com/p/froggymicroblog/">froggymicroblog</a>. It looks
      really good, with features including connectivity with Twitter and
      identi.ca sites, and more features already planned. If you like to
      microblog then I'd encourage you to try froggymicroblog. Congratulations
      to Bouleetbil.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <h3>"Change m8r"</h3>

      <p>Recently there have been a number of git commit messages stating
      "Change m8r" (or "Change maintainer" in correct English). It's exciting
      to see new developers taking over a package as its maintainer, because it
      means their confidence is increasing. Those developers who previously
      maintained these packages are probably celebrating, because it means they
      can focus on other things. Whichever view you take, it's good for
      Frugalware.</p>

  <h2>Frugalware's developers are people too - TranzeManiaC</h2>

  <p>This issue's interview is with TranzeManiaC. I should point out that he's
  not in a trance, nor is he a maniac. With that explained, here is his
  interview.</p>

  <dl>
    <dt><strong>What's your name?</strong></dt>

    <dd>
      <p>My given name is Patric Christian Werme.</p>
    </dd>

    <dt><strong>What's your IRC nickname?</strong></dt>

    <dd>
      <p>It has varied slightly over the years, but my current one is
      TranzeManiaC.</p>
    </dd>

    <dt><strong>In what country do you live?</strong></dt>

    <dd>
      <p>I live in Sweden in a small town/village named Lammhult approximately
      20 km from the city Växjö.</p>
    </dd>

    <dt><strong>In what country were you born?</strong></dt>

    <dd>
      <p>I was born in Sweden, not very far away from the city
      Göteborg (Gothenburg) where I grew up.</p>
    </dd>

    <dt><strong>What do you like the most about where you live (the country
    and/or town/city)?</strong></dt>

    <dd>
      <p>What I like best about Lammhult, is that it is a small but still big
      town. Big in the sense that quite a large number of people live here, but
      there is still a "village attitude". People greet you when you pass them
      out walking (even though you may not know them). Also, I like the fact
      that it is "small" but still close to the store and bank and such things.
      If I want to get my "hands dirty" or just want to see lots of people,
      it's only 1 hour to Växjö with public
      transportation.</p>
    </dd>

    <dt><strong>What do you do for the Frugalware project?</strong></dt>

    <dd>
      <p>Not enough. But to answer the question, I work on Swedish translations
      whenever I have some free time. Also I try to spend some time in the FBTS
      (Frugalware Bug Tracking System) and see if I can help out creating a
      package someone would want or maybe even try to kill a bug by providing a
      solution. Also I try to always create bug reports if I believe something
      to be a bug. When it comes to packaging, I still have a bit more road to
      walk, and I need to get more familiar with the _F* commands. (NOT
      referring to any mature action here, but rather the _F commands used in
      FrugalBuild scripts.)</p>
    </dd>

    <dt><strong>What motivates you to work on Frugalware?</strong></dt>

    <dd>
      <p>Simply put, Frugalware itself and its community and developers. I am
      motivated by the fact that in this great community of Frugalware, there
      is a place for me too, who is not yet a very advanced Linux user. I still
      have a lot to learn, and every day working on Frugalware, I learn
      something new. This I want to share with Frugalware and its users.
      Translating Frugalware is one of the ways for me to work with it.</p>
    </dd>

    <dt><strong>What do you do when you're not working on
    Frugalware?</strong></dt>

    <dd>
      <p>When I'm not working on Frugalware I like to play games. Currently I
      am quite involved in a MMO(R)PG named EVE Online. Also, I recently lost
      my job, so I'm busy trying to get/find a new one :) When I'm not busy
      doing any of these things, I like to visit my best (and possibly only)
      IRL friend who lives only a yawn from me.</p>
    </dd>

    <dt><strong>What's the view from your front door?</strong></dt>

    <dd>
      <p>This is what the view looks like from the front door of the apartment
      house in which I'm living. The view from my apartments' door, is a view
      of the main front door.</p>
    </dd>

    "Tranzemaniac's house"></a></dd>

    <dt><strong>How did you end up using Frugalware?</strong></dt>

    <dd>
      <p>I started to use Frugalware a couple of years ago, coming from
      ArchLinux. But as I found Frugalware to be more 'sane' (to me), I decided
      to switch to it. As Frugalware was (and still is) using pacman(-g2) as
      it's package manager (with a lot of enhancements made by the Frugalware
      Development Team) the leap didn't feel to big for me. I felt the need to
      give something back, whatever I could do, so I started to be active in
      the IRC channel, helping users out as well as I could with various
      things. I started to work on some packages which people had requested in
      FBTS. The last thing I started with, after a talk with developer Priyank,
      was to get involved in translating Frugalware and its various projects to
      Swedish. The first project I started to work on was gFPM (Graphical
      Package Manger) for pacman-g2. I believe the reason why I chose this one
      at that time, was that Priyank was/is the developer of this
      package/application so I could get a little help every now and then. It
      was a bit confusing in the beginning, as I had never done anything like
      this, so there were a lot of questions about what was to be translated in
      the strings, and what was not. To be honest, I still don't know it all,
      but I'm getting closer.</p>
    </dd>

    <dd>
      <p>Being in the spotlight, I would like to mention, that I am not a
      developer of Frugalware. I am well, a Translation Developer if that's
      more accurate. I do not yet possess the know-how and the necessary skills
      to become a package maintainer/developer for Frugalware. I believe that I
      am still in the process of getting there. I am an intermediate user with
      the goal of becoming more and more active within the Frugalware Linux
      community, whether it be packaging, translating or just doing what I can
      to assist however I can.</p>

  <h2>Getting To Know You</h2>

  <p>In this section of the newsletter, we get to know Frugalware Linux a
  little at a time. This is not meant to replace the official documentation but
  instead make it easier to read. This should suit those those people who, like
  me, have short attention spans. :)</p>

  <h3>Work in progress (WIP) repositories</h3>

  <p>Frugalware's developers make use of "work in progress" (WIP) repositories
  when making large changes - e.g. upgrading Gnome. What exactly is a WIP
  repository, though, and why are they used?</p>

  <p>A WIP repository is a pacman-g2 repository - just like current or the
  stable repositories - with its own git branch. The difference is that they
  contain packages which are not ready for release. When upgrading Gnome, for
  example, there are many packages to be updated. All the relevant packages
  need to be upgraded at once, otherwise dependencies would be broken. The
  developer who's working on the Gnome upgrade updates all the relevant
  packages and makes them available in the WIP repository. Once they're all
  updated - which may take days, weeks or months - he/she can make the
  repository available for testing.</p>

  <p>With a few changes to pacman-g2's configuration file, the WIP repository
  is available for download and testing. In this case, with Gnome already
  installed, a simple "pacman-g2 -Syu" will upgrade Gnome (and any
  dependencies) to the WIP versions. If testing is successful, the changes
  which were made to packages for the Gnome upgrade can be merged with the main
  git repository and the WIP repository can be deleted.</p>

  <p>As the name suggests, WIP repositories should be considered to be "beta".
  If you want to test a WIP repository, please first contact the developer who
  owns it. They can then coordinate their testing activities and yours. Please
  note that bugs with packages from WIP repositories must ''not'' be reported
  in the Bug Tracker System.</p>

  <h2>Tips and tricks</h2><b>Disclaimer</b> - Be aware that the hints &amp;
  tips provided here have NOT been tested and so come with no warranty.

  <ul>
    <li>
      <h3>Always carry a piece of paper and a pen</h3>

      <p>In today's modern times it may seem strange that I'm recommending that
      everyone carries a piece of paper and a pen with them, but I have a good
      reason. Many years ago - and before I was married - I was staying in a
      small hotel in Paris, France. One night when I was at the bar, I met
      Halle Berry and we talked for quite a long time. She's a lovely lady and
      I really enjoyed talking with her. At one point she asked if I'd like to
      meet "the Gendarme". I immediately understood that she was talking about
      "Jean Claude Van Damme" (famous action movie actor), but didn't want to
      use his full name in case others overheard her. Of course I said "Yes"
      and she promised she would arrange a meeting.</p>

      <p>When she left the bar soon after, I asked if I might see her again and
      she said "Yes" and gave me her phone number. I didn't have anything with
      which to write down her phone number, but I felt confident I would
      remember it. To help me remember the number, she used the American method
      where letters are substituted for digits - e.g. "1800 HELP ME". The
      following morning though, I couldn't quite remember the number. I tried
      many variations of the number she'd given me - 1800 DON'T CALL, 1800 GO
      AWAY, 1800 GET LOST - but none got me in touch with her. If only I'd had
      a piece of paper and a pen, I could have written down the number
      accurately. :( Let this be a lesson to everyone - always carry a piece of
      paper and a pen!</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <h3>Picture your diff</h3>

      <p>In newsletter issue 43 I mentioned a visual diff tool named 'meld'. I
      said at the time that I wasn't sure if it was compatible with git, since
      on the meld home page several version control systems were mentioned, but
      not git. Well I recently stumbled across a tool that's part of the git
      suit of tools - git-difftool. As explained on the git site, "git-difftool
      is a git command that allows you to compare and edit files between
      revisions using common diff tools. git difftool is a frontend to git-diff
      and accepts the same options and arguments." In keeping with the Unix
      ethos of choice, you can chose which diff tool is used by git-difftool,
      including meld! When you want to view a diff you can choose between the
      standard git diff with the command "git diff", or your diff tool of
      choice with the command "git difftool". For those who understand
      something better with a picture, "git difftool" and a visual diff tool is
      just fantastic.</p>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>This section relies on your contributions! If have some tips and tricks
  that you would like to be shown in the newsletter, <em>please</em> post them
  on the forums.</p>

  <h2>Focus On Package(s)</h2>

  <h3>''arCHMage''</h3>

  <p>In the previous newsletter issue CHM2PDF was mentioned due to its ability
  to convert CHM (Compiled HTML) format files into PDF format. This time the
  focus is on <a href="http://archmage.sourceforge.net">arCHMage</a>. According
  to the web site - "arCHMage is an extensible reader and decompiler for files
  in the CHM format. This is the format used by Microsoft HTML Help, and is
  also known as Compiled HTML."</p>

  <p>"Features</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Extracting CHM content to set of HTML, CSS files and images</li>

    <li>Dumping HTML data from CHM file into standard output</li>

    <li>Serving CHM contents as a standalone HTTP server</li>

    <li>Serving CHM content with Apache by providing Apache module mod_chm</li>

    <li>Converting CHM file into another file formats (using external tools):
    Plain Text, Single HTML, PDF"</li>
  </ul>

  <p>arCHMage has more features than CHM2PDF but it's also a little more
  complex to use. If you'd prefer to convert CHM format files into something
  other than PDF, though, arCHMage is a better choice.</p>

  <h3>Wormux</h3><a href="http://www.wormux.org/">Wormux</a> is a funny,
  cartoon-style game, and best described by its own web site as follows -

  <p>"War is declared !</p>

  <p>Have the mascots of your favorite free software titles battle it out in
  the Wormux arena using dynamite, grenades, baseball bats and other
  bazookas... Exterminate your opponent in a 2D environment with toon-style
  scenery.</p>

  <p>Each player controls the team of his choice (penguin, gnu, firefox,
  wilber,...) and must destroy his adversary using more or less casual
  weapons.</p>

  <p>Although a minimum of strategy is required to vanquish, Wormux is
  pre-eminently a "convivial mass murder" game where, turn by turn, each member
  of each team attempts to produce a maximum of damage to his opponents."</p>

  <p>Everyone needs a break from the serious side of life, so I encourage you
  to try Wormux.</p><a href=
